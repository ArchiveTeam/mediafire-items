Considering it was suggested for Amuro, I think they were referring to a song from the Nanoha soundtrack. The joke is that it's heavily based on CCA's Main Title.

All you need to know (links, installing, troubleshooting, etc):
http://pastebin.com/CYDquvFD

IMPORTANT: This now works on Dolphin 4.0.

Folder containing the stuff we've done:
mediafire.com/srwgc

PDF explaining how this works and how to use the tools for translating: https://www.dropbox.com/s/rzlnrnogfzw7kk6/SRW%20GC%20Translation%20Toolkit%20Tutorial.zip

Demo Video:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93IHK2DraFE

Progress so far: Roughly 31%.

Menus translated up to mission 30.
Stages translated up to mission 19.
QC up to mission 12.
Battle lines translated up to mission 19ish.

Next thing to look forward to:
Stage 20 translation

After that:
Second Mega batch containing edited event and dialogue dialogue up to mission 20, which will mark 33% completion (of the first route).

As I was editing the script for stage 12, I realized that I needed to make pic related.

HI /m/. I've been working on this for myself, but I figured I could share this with you all. I've extended tracks from Gundam Build Fighters for use in Gundam VS games or other games with custom osts like SRW Z3. There are two versions of songs because I couldn't decide what loop sounded best on a few. Enjoy.

I've already ripped the timing from TV-Shit's hardsubs, so I can start working on the episodes in batches. Does 4 per sound good, or 6?

Well, this was pretty fast even for me. This series is just so much fun that I couldn't stop working on it. I ended up translating most of it over the weekend and managed to finish it just now.
This volume is really awesome by the way, it's pretty much all fighting and there's a bunch of original Mazinger designs and upgrades for everyone and boobies. Enjoy.

>the paint runs off the parts so don't use it.
That's because you need to do two things beforehand:
1. You need to primer the model beforehand.
2. Nail polish can be used on plastic models, but only with an airbrush and your paint is properly thinned. Nail polish (a type of hot lacquer), when brushed straight from the bottle, will come off easily. Or, worse, eat up the plastic.

OP here, found these subs... but it looks like they're meant for a rip of short peace that is all of the short animations in one big file, the screenshot I posted which is the [ReinForce] encode has all of them chopped up into the individual stories, so these subs are useless to me unless I do a bunch of editing, and I'm not a subtitle editor

line 216 or so is where the sub appears to begin to be for a farewell to arms

The book is MS Era
I know of three editions.
MS Era. The first version. Published in slightly mangled English.
MS Era 0099. Revised edition with better English and a tweak here and there in the pics
MS Era Popular Edition. Translated into Japanese with a page dropped for some reason.

http://www.mediafire.com/view/7o009d34qggwl2q/incomplete_msera_transcript.txt I transcribed this from my copy of MS Era 0099. There's an Italian gundam image site that linking to pops an instaban that has low res scans of the first version. Popular should be in /rs/ or foolz.

Alright, episode 2 is now done.
From here on, I'm doing releases in 4-5 episode batches, so the wait time will be a bit longer.

My favorite part so far are the lines that are so over-the-top, you can interpret it as anything and still be safe. Pic very much related.

Anyways, here's a link to the file:

Did you even read my post?

I posted a few mediafire links where you can download them, since I realized postimage is awful for that stuff

With not being hosted on the net I meant as in readable on some site like Dr. Neko's and there's not a single site directing you to these dl links other than some 4chan post I just made myself (and perhaps some posts from me in the 4chan archive as well, but can't expect someone to actually go there for their information).

The Iwamoto Rockman X manga is also really great. It's a shame there are only fantranslations available of it, but they do the job. The X1 manga is easy to find on Dr. Neko's site (just google scanlation Rockman X or something).

The Rockman X2 manga was also translated, but due to faggots no one has it saved a proper DL link for it at this moment. I just have the final chapter of the fantranslated Rockman X2 manga saved.

X3 isn't hosted on the net as far I know, but you can download it from here.

http://www.mediafire.com/download/izq53cce369o83f/RMX3_manga_part1.rar
http://www.mediafire.com/download/7zy077auo502lec/RMX3_manga_part2.rar
Does not include bonus chapters as they haven't been translated yet.

Just be warned though, these are quite a little bit longer than your average mangas (around 700 pages for the Rockman X3 manga).

Stay the fuck away from the Rockman Zero manga though, don't even think of touching it.

Oh yeah, the music was great - I'm thinking more of the new soundtrack they made for the movie and not just reused BGM clips from the TV series, though I'm aware that quite a few of the tracks are merely redone from TV series soundtrack.

Yeah, I've actually got a reason for that. It's been a while since I've seen Den-O, and depending on the context of what they say, I might want to translate it differently than what the previews give off.

As for the second question, it's all on Mediafire. For some reason I just keep getting the impulse to hand out only the file links instead of the actual folder.

Nah, it's fine. Sorry it took so long, Den-Anon, but here's some simple styles that may help a bit. They're basic as basic can be (and others may have better suggestions and changes) but hopefully it's a start.

Is there a shortcut for adding and removing tags in every line? It takes a good chunk of time to do for each one.

>>10495930
Most likely. I just want to push out the first 2 episodes first to see if they're good enough to keep going. No sense in releasing to people who don't want it.

Ladies and gentlemen.

6 hours and 20 minutes of work, an additional 30 minutes of removing HTML tags I put in (whoops), and 2 hot pockets later, I've finished the first episode of Den-O.

Now I did take the time to rewatch, listen, and compare all that good shit. There are a few things here and there that aren't perfectly translated, but I can assure you that it won't interferer with the plot or your viewing experience in any way (pic related).

Feel free to use and edit this however you see fit, and be sure to let me know how it was.

It's /m/ because space stations and droids and shit.
Basically, back in our college days, me and two other guys made this horror game, which is looking old and embarassing now. So we're going back, giving it a graphical update, new voice acting etc etc... and this is the new intro sequence I just knocked up.
Compare it to the old 2005 version with my shitty drawings:

Ladies and gentlemen.

6 hours and 20 minutes of work, an additional 30 minutes of removing HTML tags I put in (whoops), and 2 hot pockets later, I've finished the first episode of Den-O.

Now I did take the time to rewatch, listen, and compare all that good shit. There are a few things here and there that aren't perfectly translated, but I can assure you that it won't interferer with the plot or your viewing experience in any way (pic related).

Feel free to use and edit this however you see fit, and be sure to let me know how it was.

I've got it right here. A SRW Alpha 3 download.
http://www.mediafire.com/download/o8a1ypq5bdp1a3p/srwa3+ost.rar

The metadata and shit might not be all there. It was already used and shit when I got it, and after years of trying to translate and retag it I decided to say fuck it and I lazily ran it through an auto-tagger.

We should probably put some of this stuff into a pastebin or something, because they've gotten pretty scattered over time.

For those unfamiliar, "Plamo" is a shortened form of "plastic model." If it's made of plastic, someone can probably help you here.

I've got it right here. A SRW Alpha 3 download.
http://www.mediafire.com/download/o8a1ypq5bdp1a3p/srwa3+ost.rar

The metadata and shit might not be all there. It was already used and shit when I got it, and after years of trying to translate and retag it I decided to say fuck it and I lazily ran it through an auto-tagger.

We should probably put some of this stuff into a pastebin or something, because they've gotten pretty scattered over time.

I have most of it, but it's from years ago and I'm pretty sure the download went the way of Megaupload, sadly. I'll upload it to Mediafire later if I have time.

I know it's overkill, that's why I put a mediafire link in the comment to just download from there. It also gets more exposure and life expectancy if it's posted on nyaa.

What do you mean? I released stage 11 in my usual format and then I released a "fixed" version (I don't remember what needed fixing, though) which was just the text files without including the textures. You mean those files don't work? I'm looking at them now and they seem to be good.

Here's the folder with everything I released for this project.

Alright guys. That's act 1 done. When Oppai translates this, we'll have 26/80 stages and substages done. Just a little less than 1/3, although I'm sure the event dialogue will still get longer.

In stage related things, I see that the GC/NEO/OE team reused this particular idea of a dimensional warp in OE.

Bring, it looks like you forgot to put the textures for the second scene into their individual folders. Instead they were all inside a single folder and the folders for the individual lines were all empty. I was still able to work with it though, I deleted all the yellow lines and ordered the white ones by date. It matched up with the text file, fortunately.

There should be links for the original show OSTs around somewhere. If not, I'll come back in 2 hours and see if I can reupload them.

I have a gift for you.

If you've never heard any Hummingbird (Yoshiki Fukuyama's real life band until they split up and he joined JAM Project) then prepare to cry tears of happiness and strange melancholy as Basara's voice sings to you about everything from the Galapagos islands, to making a map, to fishing:

http://www.mediafire.com/download/4zmpj5j9h04177u/HummingBird.rar

The discography info:
http://www.fukuyama-yoshiki.net/disco_hummingbird.html

The album "123" is fucking incredible and came out as Mac 7 was airing. It has a lot of Firebomber songs on it but with different lyrics ("Mada ma ni au sa" instead of "Power to the Dream," "Fly Away" instead of "Try Again," etc)

I have the files directly from the app, but I'm sure there's some kind of encryption there to prevent sharing but fuck if I know what it is.

Here's the file for the sampler if someone can figure out a way to make it work

Thanks, man. That's awesome. It wasn't much more than a curiosity.

And for whoever was asking about Advance of Zeta...

Here's chapters 1-5 in English.

and the full script for volumes 1-4 in bad English (the typo in the picture isn't an ironic one)

This might be too much to ask but to whoever is scanning Mazinger Otome, please, at least, upload them to mediafire and/or sendspace.

For most people, those filehosts are the easiest to download from.

Hi guys.

I know how rare this game is and how hard is to find even a good torrent for it, so I wanted to be a cool guy and give you a magnet for it.

I'm not too experienced in torrents so if it doesn't work, here's a Mediafire link for it too.

Also, I ask you for patience.
My country's internet connection sucks and I can't seed all day long but I'll do all the time I can.

That being said, enjoy.

I translated this really old, obscure Gundam manga a few years back. Only like two or three people actually downloaded it from my Mediafire account, which has long since been lost. I could upload it again if people are interested at all.

It's just under 30 pages, and is really non-canon even for a manga. It's about Tem Ray using a captured Zeon pilot to test his prototype RX78 (which is goofy looking as fuck, see pic) and befriending him 4 months before the events of the show. It was a pretty fun little read.

If anyone is interested I could re-upload it somewhere tomorrow.

I can't torrent from where I am because downloads are monitored and account activity reported to the university. Has to be through a DDL. I'm asking for whatever MediaFire links people are carrying around for this kind of stuff.

I hate asking, but it's either this or ripping an .mp3 off of YouTube in all its yamato damashitty quality

Unfortunately they don't align perfectly by sample, not even closely, I fucked around with channels and filters and it still rings but generally turned out okay.

I like the 0080 opening song but after so many years of it being in VS games I finally broke down and made an extended version of Imaginary Sky's 2nd movement to replace it. It's about 5 minutes long so it should last for most matches without restarting.

Now you can channel your inner hygogg too!

and for those who don't know the song

http://youtu.be/GYCrluZwiUk?t=1m8s

I have some free time over the next few days so if there are any extension requests I can give it a shot.

And that's it.

Well, Mechanismo's story only crops up twice more. Once in an Alien crossover and once when MacGruder finally loses. (And, yes, this does bite Dredd in the ass)

Anyway, you can catch this, and other 2000AD tales to thrill in https://www.mediafire.com/folder/vn67877vvqmaf/2000_AD

Next time, I'll be bringing in a story with an ending that isn't anywhere near as happy. It involves cyborgs, power suits, and the ways to break a man.

What better way to celebrate my birthday than by helping some people online steal copies of a decade old cartoon about a frog! Clearly these thirty-three years have been well spent.

I'm going to be doing follow-ups that work with the same directories as I find more episodes. I'll also eventually throw in the first PS2 game.

The torrent will probably work. So far I've been able to get these going but that's been due to luck more than knowledge.

For those of you just joining us, please read this guide. I've done my best to answer basic and commonly asked questions. Please read it before asking questions as there is a chance it has already been answered there.

For those unfamiliar, "Plamo" is a shortened form of "plastic model." If it's made of plastic, someone can probably help you here.

For those of you just joining us, please read this guide. I've done my best to answer basic and commonly asked questions. Please read it before asking questions as there is a chance it has already been answered there.

For those unfamiliar, "Plamo" is a shortened form of "plastic model." If it's made of plastic, someone can probably help you here.

What better way to celebrate my birthday than by helping some people online steal copies of a decade old cartoon about a frog! Clearly these thirty-three years have been well spent.

I'm going to be doing follow-ups that work with the same directories as I find more episodes. I'll also eventually throw in the first PS2 game.

The torrent will probably work. So far I've been able to get these going but that's been due to luck more than knowledge.

Alright, at long last I have stage 19 complete! Pic very related

Also, while saving the stage, I realized that the memory card was one of the things that didn't get saved in the most recent backup. So I have all of my meticulous saves up to stage 16, then a blank spot, then stage 19. Thank God for save states. Didn't have to replay everything.

Well, the original Arashi manga is fully translated.

It's an interesting read. Of all Ishinomori's manga I've read, I think its hero is the most removed from his TV persona, despite still having many similarities. It's a strange story, less a tale of good vs. evil and more one man on a quest for revenge, with a killer twist at the end and a rather bleak message overall.

Here's the links for it:

>did anyone ever do a proper english version of the high res popular edition of MS era? 
afaik there is no version of Popular Edition that shops in English text
>I realize the popular edition adds a few slides that weren't in the already translated one,
it does? I know there's a page missing from Popular that's in Era 0099, that's image related scanned from my copy. There's also some image tweaks from Era to the revised 0099, like that Byg Zam pic is made black and white, I think.
>but you'd think by now someone had just copied over the existing english text from the old ones
I've transcribed most of MS Era 0099, and I scanned that page that's missing from Popular at least.

Anyway, for those of you still hanging around, a rough count shows I have roughly 200 images left to go. I've been at this for over twelve hours by now, and I greatly appreciate you putting up with this. I'll just throw up the rar for you all to enjoy on your own time. Odds are you'll be able to get through them faster without waiting for me to cycle through them.

Enjoy. I'm off to make some dinner. Sorry I couldn't get through the whole folder.

I don't anticipate a lot of downloads, though.

The server we use for those is down again (Ignis keeps telling us it can't be our stuff that's making it trip the bandwidth limit but as it's only happened since using that particular server to handle script/patch load for a weekly, I imagine it has to be)

so we're using Mediafire for them this week and I'm not sure if 4chan plays nice with those links or not. They'll be in the release post anyway.

Stitch In Time is way cool. But it needs a big warning about how it takes all the mystery out of Garak. Every shady story about his past he makes allusions to in the show is spelled out blow for blow in the book. If you want THE ANSWERS about Garak they're all there. But you may like him for the mysteries.

on the subject of ancillary Trek materials the old DC comics set between movies 2 and 3 are pretty cool. http://www.mediafire.com/folder/tcdq1of8bdjem/trek_comics

Since a scrub project of Kabuto failed and burned hard. I decided to share the scripts I had worked with. (I forget which group these were from so I can't give credit for them)

https://www.mediafire.com/?3rkhnaz9ypd3q49 These are from 1 to 18, and perfectly timed up with the bunnyhat raws.

Here's a small thing I've been doing during free time, O-T's Gokaiger subs re-timed for BunnyHat's Bluray encodes along with futzing with the sub styles for a 720p video instead of the tiny ass RAWs they used before. If fonts are too small or whatever, oh well, I tried. Also touched up the dialogue just a little bit, mainly just making sure the earlier episodes referred to "Ooinaru Chikara" as "Ultimate Power" like O-T finally settled on for the series by episode 15.

So far I've only done up to episode 16, but that should be enough for now, since after 16 you're supposed to watch 199 Heroes to keep your fix going. Or... whatever.

Backland Stride Motherfuckers!

http://www.mediafire.com/view/kmwfvaiuekodpow/BacklandStridePreview.pdf
Here's some motherfucking GAME related content. And by Game Related, I mean I've come to give you /m/en a preview of Backland Stride, which includes the mechanics and character creation rules for the game, along with equipment and mecha customization.

Now, what is Backland Stride you ask? Well, I'll tell you sons of bitches what it is. Backland Stride is an in development Roleplaying Game set in the year 2625 in a small sector of space called the Cygnus Marche, more commonly known as the Cygnus Backlands. Shit is cyberpunk and transhuman as fuck: Almost everyone is genetically enhanced in some form or another, and cybernetic and nanomachine augmentations are as common as pharmaceutical drugs are today. Oh, and the universe is in the middle of a Cold War. That's kinda important: The Allied Stellar Compact, known as the Alliance, fought a ten year long war 35 years ago against a rival multinational organization known as the Collective. Now, neither of these groups are pretty and faultless, but the Collective are some heads up bad assholes. And we're not talking some bullshit Universal Century Gundam style "OH NO THE FEDERATION IS CORRUPT THAT MEANS THEY'RE EVIL WHILE ZEON IS SO NOBLE AND SHIT" This is some real straight up shit, motherfuckers. The Alliance is pretty corrupt and has it's fair share of self serving individuals but the Collective Practices slavery, some collective planets have a brutal version of the Hindu Caste System, one of their planets is just MuvLuv Japan in Space(Complete with Yamato Damashii and Racism), one is a conquered banana republic, and one is just straight up a eusocial all female planet.

But Fivemarks, you ask, What the fuck should I give a shit about Backland Stride and not something like Mekton, or Pheonix Command, Or some shitty System that uses Dark Heresy for mecha? I'll tell you why:

Rips were made from the CDs that I got myself for Christmas, everything is in FLAC (level 8), track titles are in romanized Japanese (a few were already in English).

Subs for the series itself might follow one day when I get some time...

First third of Hibiki.

I went over TV-N's subs and tried to fix the mistakes I could found, comparing their script to the Japanese captions.
I can't guarantee that I haven't made mistakes myself. I'm far from perfect in Japanese.
Also, many lines are still identical to the original release.
It's not a perfect release, but it should still be a better alternative.

Here are patches
http://www.mediafire.com/?065doz475lbmc1b

For these raws
http://www.nyaa.se/?page=view&tid=440475

I'm really sorry if there are any mistakes.
You can make ddls or torrents of these episodes if you want.
Feel free to use the scripts if you want to make a new translation from scratch.

The files have two tracks
Track 1 uses Masked Rider, Ogre, Servant, Princess
Track 2 uses Kamen Rider, Oni, Douji, Hime
Both tracks have western name order, no honorifics, the word Makamou and the names of the Makamou left as-is.

Kamen Rider General 208: All you need is love edition

I like how the big draw to the article is ''THE REASON WHY GAIM WAS DELAYED'', but the translation is wrong and has jack shit to do with why it started in Oct.

Translation in the article:
>Gaim was delayed one month, and started in October. This is because the power up item would clash with the first set of toys during Christmas. This meant I couldn’t introduce new items and characters until after that point.

Transcription of the original text:
1???????????
7????????????????????????????????
??????????????????????????????

Actual translation:
>The show started a month later than usual, so I had to introduce all the merchandise intended for the Christmas period by episode 7. The only thing I had time for in the beginning was showing those items and introducing all the characters.

Another victory for toku news sites!

Had a quick glance and they seem to work but they're de-synchronized. Slow by about a second to the audio, I'm using the rip of the Official Blu-Ray by [Daman] if it helps. Dialogue wise though they're a hell lot more coherent at least.

Happy new year, /m/en, it's time for another /m/ soundtrack! I was going to originally release the Best of /m/ album at this time, but I still need to figure some shit for that out (Seriously, go vote on that shit). In the meantime, have an album that I've wanted to do for almost two years. It's a simple BGM album for those tracks that play when shit is getting real, or things are calm and/or mysterious. All your favorites are here folks (Final Fusion, Stoner Sunshine, V-MAX, etc) so come get it.

The Best Of album should be out next month at the latest, so look out for it too.

Mediafire seems to have nuked the raw links. I suppose i could reupload them if you really, really want them for some reason.

/a/non's english translated stuff is pretty much equivalent in image quality if that's what you're worried about.

So here's a bunch of saves:
https://www.mediafire.com/?vaq51n6o87xqiz3

Both right before the best ending in Z1 and Alpha 3, Cobray and Setsuko routes, in case anyone wants to dick around.

Cobray's save is on slot 2, and Setsuko's on slot 5, in case you want to try it out, so you don't end up overwriting any older save.

Well well! Behold in shitty ipad compression:

http://www.mediafire.com/download/22jne362plcx6i4/WIP_fao+_M_.ipad.mp4

Here's how much I've done on this thing so far. There's some new bits in there and lots of old bits have been fixed up. I'm also traying to smooth out the narrative flow- for instance it doesn't just cut to asteroid dodging now. There's an establishing shot before it. I'll be going through and doing that for any bits which seem out of place, and then actually sticking an ending on it.

Throw your criticisms at me, constructive or otherwise! Though I'm going to be having a shower and eating stuff and possibly falling asleep so I might have to address stuff tomorrow if I just pass out.

Evening /m/, just wanted to remind you that Christmas is next week, which means that the deadline is drawing near. I finished working on everything necessary, so all that remains is getting more submissions. Since the amount that I have right now is pretty small even for such slow threads, I'm willing to extend the deadline if necessary, but not for long, so if you still haven't send me your covers, do it as soon as possible. I'm counting on you, guys.

I found this the other day: Airfix Model World Special / Scale Modeling Step-by-Step.
From all the documents I have, this is the best guide for complete beginners. It covers tools, assembly, types of paint, normal and airbrushes, decalling, weathering. There's nothing in particular for gunpla (which rarely appears in model magazines), but all of the techniques apply.

Yes, it's a PDF file. However, it's an official release, not a scan: it has fully searchable text

I can't upload to Mediafire, because it's too big. However, I downloaded this... God, 2? 3? years ago? Maybe it a bit longer?

Whatever, I got it off The Pirate Bay. I think the torrent might still be up, but I can't check it here. Torrent sites are blocked on this network.

no,l but honestly it should. There is one anon who does the next thread properly, and links the new thread in triplicate in the old thread.

I have no idea who keeps co-opting it and doing it in a fail manner.

anyway, reposting GBF:A chapters 1-2 in case anyone missed it and wanted a go at it.

An 2002 age event. Footage is included in a DVD that comes with the first press edition of MuvLuv Supplement.
In the event they announced the release date for MuvLuv (everybody went apeshit) and then there's Kuribayashi Minami singing a few songs.
Here's the best GIF I can make.

You did not give any instructions on what to draw, so I designed my own things for your game.

Also on account of such a promising game, I have decided to double my usual working resolution. Sure, that's more work for me but I feel your game deserves the detail and crispness of 8x8 sprites.

http://www.mediafire.com/download/buhbzexb0isia33/Your+Game+Shall+Be+Great.zip

Enclosed is sprites for the three main characters, their super forms and four bad guys. I'm sure you don't need anything else to make your game.
You're welcome.

Don't worry too much about it because I keep a local copy of everything so I need to download it anyways, it's really only the upload that get to skip.

This is only necessary if you're running Dolphin 4.0 or higher (3.0 doesn't require this). Then again, why would you use something lower than 4.0 is beyond me.

I think Guy G got those files up to stage 10. Probably some of some male route as well.

We're running with the default settings and the options for loading textures. It's all in the pastebin in the OP.

Please don't, that doesn't help us.

Whenever you find a untranslated line:
1. Save state
2. Turn on "Dump Textures"
3. Load state. (yes this is important, don't skip this step.
4. press "b, a, a"
5. repeat step 4 until you run out of untranslated lines.
6. Fire up the texture organizer.
7. Organize the textures.
8. Upload the textures (MF is a great choice because it lets me copy your contribution over to my folder without having to download and upload).
9. Post your progress here.

Also, I just noticed that we have the female super route dumped up to stage 10.

Okay guys! Back on track.

I don't know if it's related to the novel, but from what I read on anon post, there seems to be similarities on the characterization in 00 Yun Kouga's manga.

Here's if any of you interested.

Volume II is more focused on the latter episodes of the war, plus the Federation's characters and hardware.

Same caveats from Volume I apply:

Another Century Chronicle
Anonymous Sun Dec 01 2013 15:38:20 No.9963314 ViewReport	
More uploads. This time is the Another Century Chronicle books, a compendium on the One Year War. Quoting HLJ:
>Included are a detailed history guide to the beginning and ending of the One Year War, Zeon operations and campaigns undertaken during the war, and information on the mobile suits, vehicles, warships, and weaponry used. Gorgeous realistic illustrations of the characters and mobile suits are found throughout the book
While the text is in Japanese, the maps are great. It has some magnificent illustrations as well of both Zeon and EF equipment.

Since it's in Japanese reading order, you need to read the files from the bottom up so the pages match.

Yes, these are PDFs too. Stop complaining. Be sure to activate "Show Cover Page During Two-Up" for the two-page spreads I had to apply Lanczos sampling to the original JPGs to equalize the page heights, which were all over the place in the original download, plus leaving the BW pages in grayscale. The PDFs themselves do not, again, DO NOT, have any further compression

Here is the torrent. Some episodes are split into unequal parts, the quality is bad and the audio uses a strange codec, but here it is.

Someone should make a package of the YT ripped ones, if not I'll make one tomorrow (maybe).

That's the last one. There's also one of the VF-25 Messiah, which I didn't download because I really, really dislike the look of Frontier's VF's. Those long noses and stylized shapes put me off. VF-0 achieved a decent balance between new and old

Another month means yet another /m/ Soundtrack. Bringing in the hip beats of new shows like Build Fighters and Space Dandy, along with some old classics by JAM project and Aniki, Album 15 is here! You can grab it here:
https://www.mediafire.com/?95hj514kr75nyqi

You can also grab the other albums here:
http://msoundtrack.tumblr.com/

Now for some info on what's happening with these things. The basis for the next five themed albums are set in stone at this point. A bunch of tracks for each album are also in place. The only one that's still not set in stone is the /m/'s Top 30 album. And that's where you all come in. (cont.)

The OST 2 was basically a rehash of the songs from the Mini Albums 1&2 plus 2 new songs that in my opinion wasn't worth paying over $40 over.

Here's the link that featured the new songs someone else uploaded that was on the album Ale!Ale! Kyoryuger and Courage Explosion

Friendly reminder that I've started accepting recordings for /m/ and /a/ ML singing collaboration. The song list is:
"Muv-Luv";
"I Will";
"Song from the distant Earth";
"Asu e no Houkou";
"Carry On";
"Tsubasa";
"Saigo no Eden";
"Sora wo Yuku Kibou no Uta" (TDA ED).

All songs will be compiled into a medley, as well as uploaded separately. The deadline is Christmas, and I hope to upload the everything on Youtube by the New Year.

Instead of whining about the subs, I decided to take matters into my own hands and fix things myself. I created a fansubbing dream team specifically for this, and only this.

I give you, the definitive Gaim Episode 6.

Danball Senki BOOST translation
CrashmanX !!GAKnwBRBYtV Tue Nov 19 2013 21:57:28 No.9912474 ViewReport	
So if anyone actually cares anymore here's all the work I did on Danball BOOST.
I stopped working on it about 3 months ago. I've lost just about all interest in the games and series. With it also announced as being localized, at least the anime, I've lost a huge drive to do it because that means the games will be coming out in english.

What's translated:
Lots of menus. All the parts names. Pretty much all the items. A bunch of the errors. All kinds of various things. Just a ton of stuff overall.
What's not translated:
Story. Multiplayer menus. Menus that I missed.
Stuff that I didn't get to.

Will I continue work:
Maybe? I dunno. I'll gladly provide tools/resources if anyone wishes to continue my work. The game is fully translation capable and there's tools to make it very easy if you're interested.

Instructions are included in the ReadMe.

if you or anyone wants a bigger folder, I have a 92mb collection of various art from the old SeedSearch sites and engines circa 2006. ... it's a pretty big, mixed variety/archive of all the druggie art I could find back then, before Pixiv replaced the search indexes and individual fansites.

mostly Seed, less destiny. never got into them.

Sorry for the wait, everyone. My computer crashed when downloading some shit last night and the uploads didn't get completed.

The Mediafire link has all the Top Ten books (that I'm aware of). Reading order would be Top Ten/Top Ten: The 49ers, Smax, and then Top Ten: Beyond the Farthest Precinct.

Beyond the Farthest Precinct has a bit more Joe Pi, but he's criminally underused. Smax isn't /m/, but it's a fun read. The 49ers is basically "Have some gorgeous fucking art, some aerial combat scenes, and robots vs. vampires".

Sorry, didn't mean to throw Valhalla up in here. It's not really /m/, but a fun read anyway. Peter Madsen does the Norse Myth with a comical twist. The art's pretty fantastic, though.

That's it for tonight. I've got more hot stories on the plate, however, so don't you worry about that.

Sorry for the wait, everyone. My computer crashed when downloading some shit last night and the uploads didn't get completed.

The Mediafire link has all the Top Ten books (that I'm aware of). Reading order would be Top Ten/Top Ten: The 49ers, Smax, and then Top Ten: Beyond the Farthest Precinct.

Beyond the Farthest Precinct has a bit more Joe Pi, but he's criminally underused. Smax isn't /m/, but it's a fun read. The 49ers is basically "Have some gorgeous fucking art, some aerial combat scenes, and robots vs. vampires".

They're not really great video quality to start with, and I'm sure there's plenty of options for stealing HnK already, so it's not like I need to try to get BunnyHat / EG stuff.

Well, the first one of Beatrix, I found in the wiki.

The rest are scans I got about a year ago, I think. I'm thinking of uploading the rars to mediafire. Or maybe just give them to KNG for his stash.

Not all of them are color, sadly, and in fact, I'd like to know where I can get volumes with where the color isn't restricted to the covers and some of the first pages.

I ripped the audio from Aesir's HD episode 4 release and limited it so it would be considerably louder, but not enough to lose a lot of dynamics. This is closer to the commercial levels that will come out when the single is here.

this isn't a complete game, it's a tweak for PDQ Truth and Justice.

Basically your character gets ranks of Attributes and ranks of "tangibles" which are item-based attributes that can be taken away. This adds another category, "Unit Tangibles" which are specifically for the mech meaning they only work after launching. Characters gain a set amount of chips, which are basically action points. In vanilla TnG you just spend those to get a +2 on any roll. In this, I've added specific chip abilities instead which are basically Super Robot Wars seishins.

Hm... there's probably some people out there that won't be that familiar with crabsticks, so I guess I'll upload the Netherlands part in a separate file. We have a "Jokes" section in the mediafire folder for something!

I've read a couple of times here that Nagano was pissed at Tomino (or Sunrise, not sure) after L-Gaim because most of his ideas for the show were rejected, so he went on to create Five Star Stories after that. At least a Fatima appeared in the sketches he drew (which I can't locate now) and there's also some art like this one.

It's that time of the week again!

This week, we're taking a trip to the 1980s, a time of rollerskating, hair metal, and prog rock. Also lolis and really hilarious fashion styles. Sometimes both together.

Put any songs you'd like to request for 80's under HAIR. We'll be doing 25 of those. I.E. Dragonar, Nadesico, Layzner, ZZ. You know the drill. (not the piercing one, face on chest one, or dinosaur fucking one, those are different drills)

Anything else can go under SHENANIGANS, which will be the other 25. Shenanigans will be kind of like the normal block, but less topical, more silly, and possibly stuff that may or may not actually sound like music and/or sound pleasing. I'll be doing it near the end. Word of note: I'm letting you guys request virtually anything for shenanigans. I'll decide whether or not to play it, but you can do anything. I'll TRY to keep it /m/ related, but we'll see.

Show starts at 7PM PST, 10PM EST, 2AM GMT.

MP3s of the last two songs should hopefully be showing in the MEGA folder by the time the show starts. Mediafire says my files are too large for them, so they aren't an option.

The opening I got was slightly different to the first opening, you're right. I chose this because it had more faces in it. The reference video is here if you wanted to have a look: http://www.mediafire.com/download/pa4jk3dxb28jyr0/Macross_OP_HD_Clean.mkv

Here's the L-Gaim name list I've been compiling. Some of it might go totally unused in-game, but that's fine, too.

http://www.mediafire.com/?x0dqup1m65e0e0s

Most of them are okay, but there are a few names I don't really get, like MkII's flight mode, its Spiral Flow's name, and the armor material, as I said before.

Here's stage 16. This stage gave us Sieg and Sally's full names as well as the names of a couple more original characters. They're all made up alien names, so the romanization can be tricky. The only source I found is this jap wiki at wiki.cre.jp/SRW, so for now I'm going by what it says. It seems consistent with most of the names we know, though some seem a bit weird (????? as "Helluga" doesn't seem quite right to me), but I don't really have a better plan for it.
Also, I guess it's fine to call people from Gadisword "Gadiswordians"? It's annoying having to work all lines to say "from Gadisword" instead, using a demonym often sounds better.

Bring, did you miss the dialogue between Sieg and Sally that happens during the stage? It triggered when I attacked a random grunt with Akimi, so it seems kinda hard to miss. I dumped it myself though, no problem. It wasn't too long.

I don't think anyone uploaded the full album since it only had 2 new songs and the rest of the album was songs that was already released on mini albums 1&2.

Here's the DL for the 2 tracks (Ale Ale! Kyoryuger & Courage explosion) that was new on the album.

what I do is run the BNO launcher through applocale with the JP lanaugage pack installed

use this
http://www.mediafire.com/download/ekuca5246za6qy1/HF+pAppLoc.rar

install and when it's done open mudfish first then right click the BNO launcher shortcut, and "run with japanese applocale as admin"

should fix the problem

Anyone wants my savegame? There's a big chance it will appear as corrupted in your PSP, because of firmware difference (also you must have all DLCs).

If anyone is interested, I can host it on mediafire or whatever. It has 280 hours, 30+ mechs fully upgraded and 16.000 EC.

As I promised last week, I'm back with the Into the Sky scans. I don't really know anything about scanning, I bought this stuff for myself mostly. In other words, bitching isn't appreciated, but constructive criticism is.

Somehow, Rapidshare got better, and I don't know how. I still remember how they limited free users to 10KB/s and you could only download one file a day, then it was 50KB/s but unlimited downloads, and now I think it's unrestricted.

Okay, so here's the thing. The folder, when compressed it about 1.4 GB. Do you want me to upload it to a site like mediafire (I'll have to make 10 split archives) or do you know a site where I can upload a single file that is more than 1 GB? I'd make a torrent, but those usually go pretty slow without seeders.

I've tried to make the reference image a bit more informative this time (please follow the checklist!), but my suggestions are just suggestions, and you guys are free to draw this opening in whatever way you like. Post here to reserve some images, draw them up, and then shoot me an email with the finished drawings when you're done. When you're done, go ahead and reserve some more images if you want! Posting your progress here is fine, but personally, I like to be surprised so by no means do you have to post your finished product here.

Again, if you have any questions or concerns, post here or send me an email. I'll keep the picture updated (when I'm awake) with the latest reservations/progress.

DYNAMO JOE
Thundernon Mon Oct 07 2013 15:16:33 No.9734002 ViewReport	
Hey, /m/. Miss me?

I meant to throw this up a month ago, but it didn't quite happen due to sudden unemployment issues. But I'm here now. So here we have it, by request, Dynamo Joe! Brought to us in the mid 1980s by First Comics, it features the writing talents of the talented John Ostrander and, later, Phil Foglio. (Unfortunately, Foglio doesn't do art, so we don't get any of his voluptuous vixens.) It's one of the first (I won't say the first period, because I don't know) original American mecha comics.

I haven't read a lot of it but it's real short. I'll probably get through it with you guys in about two days. Maybe three. The basic plot is that three civilizations (that didn't get on well anyway) are being invaded by another group of aliens that forces them to team up.

And giant robots are involved.

For those of you who missed all of my Zoids UK posts, you can find them http://www.mediafire.com/folder/5yk539mbzt8kk/Zoids plus a few side-features and one-shots that I didn't storytime.

I've also still got ROM and Shogun Warriors up if anyone needs them.

Where are you getting grey hair from that line?
???? is probably the past of ?? (???): to endure; to keep out (e.g. rain); to stave off (e.g. starvation); (2) to pull through; to get over; to survive; (3) to surpass;
??? (n) (1) intention; plan; (2) conviction; belief;

So it could be "I bet you thought you were gonna make it/survive/get through this (but you're not because I'm support attacking)"? Or something.

HELLO AND WE'RE BACK WITH SEASON 2 OF /m/ DRAWS MECHA. THIS EDITION'S WINNER IS THE GLORIOUS SDF MACROSS (http://strawpoll.me/502878/r)! FOR A SEASON ONE RECAP, GO HERE: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZlhyQcQ-wA

I've tried to make the reference image a bit more informative this time (please follow the checklist!), but my suggestions are just suggestions, and you guys are free to draw this opening in whatever way you like. Post here to reserve some images, draw them up, and then shoot me an email with the finished drawings when you're done. When you're done, go ahead and reserve some more images if you want! Posting your progress here is fine, but personally, I like to be surprised so by no means do you have to post your finished product here.

Again, if you have any questions or concerns, post here or send me an email. I'll keep the picture updated (when I'm awake) with the latest reservations/progress.

KimiGuy also uploaded them to a separate mediafire account due to their size. You can find the link foolz or in his blog. The rumor is that he has larger, more high quality scans as well. I guess he got tired other people uploading his shit on exhentai.

LAST TIME ON /m/ DRAWS SOME MECHA,

- G GUNDAM WINS BY A VOTE THANKS TO DYNAMIC IPS
- ANON RELEASES HIS FANTASTIC SHIN MAZINGER MS PAINT OPENING (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vWUm86GraaA) AND KEEPS MY THREAD BUMPED
- AND WE NEED TO GET OUR SHIT TOGETHER AND VOTE DRAGONAR NEXT TIME SO WE CAN KEEP GETTING SUBS

But enough about that, time for the G Gundam screencaps! You will find them here, at http://imgur.com/a/g0iXh#0

If you don't have it and wish to use the wonderful XP Paint, I've uploaded it here for your pleasure: http://www.mediafire.com/download/z9h9fypt9obnj23/mspaint_xp.exe

So here's how we should go about this in a nice orderly way:
- Check out the imgur link and choose one or two images to reserve at a time (No more than 2 please!)
- Choosing two images that go together (eg 1 and 2) is fine but by no means expected
- If there's a frame I didn't cap and you want to draw it, let me know! Otherwise,
- Note the numbers and check the thread to make sure they haven't been taken
-If they haven't, go ahead and post in the thread to indicate they're reserved
- YOU GET TO DRAWING
- Images should be 1280x720 pngs (or prepare to get rescaled)
- If you want a sprite animated separately from the background, draw the sprite separately and make it transparent in photoshop
- Email me when you're done at mdrawsmecha@gmail.com with instructions (if necessary) as to how you want the frame animated
- I'll leave it up to you as to whether you want to post your progress and/or finished frames in the thread, but my preference is to keep things a surprise until the video is done!

I'll update the list every so often. Any questions/comments etc just post in the thread or email me if you want it a secret. MOST IMPORTANTLY: HAVE FUN WITH THIS!

The last 70's and 80's mecha thread have reached it's image limit and is unable to fill its purpose. So, we'll let him rest in peace and summon this new 70's & 80's mecha thread in order to keep the legacy going. If you weren't there when it was still in a good shape, just check the last thread here : >>9581226 and get all the stuff you can before it go away for the eternity, forcing you to dig in various archives...

Most of you already know the rules, right? If not, here's what this thread is for: argue, discuss and dump stuff like artworks, fanarts (if they're well made of course), sketches, magazines' scans, artbooks, DVD/VHS/LD/CD/BD's covers, ads, musics, screencaps and so on, that have a link to a Sci-Fi and Mecha anime/comic/novel/film/OVA.

Here are a few links to interesting websites:

Speaking of Endoh, he actually made a theme song for the official SRW webradio, Umasugi Wave. It's really damn rad. And the refrain is a list of spirit commands which is kinda cool.

Once again, it's the most /m/usically inclined time of the month! The time for the lucky 13th /m/ soundtrack has finally come, with a bunch of songs you may or may not have wanted, some you probably didn't even know exist. I've been getting pretty obscure with these next few albums, so expect songs from the likes of Iczer-3, Gowkaiser, X-Bomber, and more!

The 13th album can be found here: http://www.mediafire.com/download/kgic18oop4uqrd3/

Hey everyone, I had asked yesterday in the previous thread if anyone had translated the Heisei Rider novels, and it looked like no one has yet. Whether that's because of a lack of source or maybe translating is too much effort, that's fine. I understand that translating takes a lot of time and can be boring and I don't want to be ungrateful/take people for granted.

But I bought the Kamen Rider W novel, and unfortunately, I can't read Japanese. But I wanted to be able to put the raws out there, just in case anyone was interested in translating, or maybe if there are people who know how to read Japanese and don't feel like getting the book but are interested.

Here's the link: http://www.mediafire.com/?753kyz5o5fygml8

Just a few notes:
- Hopefully I didn't miss any pages, I took them all as screenshots on my phone since I couldn't figure out how to extract the actual Kindle file from my phone. (I tried to go into the phone's Kindle directory, but it wasn't in the eBooks folder.)
- Some pages are duplicates, because when I lost track of the page I was on, I would go into Photos to double check, and go back to the Kindle app and for some reason it'd push the page a line back, so I just took two photos of it.
- When you open the zip/folder, it should be sorted like 1, 2, 3... etc. If not, sort it by date.

Anyway, if someone would be willing to translate it, that'd be great! If not, that's fine too!

So I re-did Hibiki's first episode.
Most of the translation is actually identical to KitScrubs' release, so I guess there wasn't really a point in re-doing this.

Patch is intended for "[Bunny_Hat_Raw]Hibiki_01_(8066FDD2).mkv"

It's pathetic how a few bitches caused so much trouble.
The media fire folder sounds like a good idea.
You could post it at the beginning of each thread, with something along the lines of,
'Get last weeks steam here!'.

I'd be slightly worried copyright issues, mediafire has that whole autoscan and block shit going on.

>A faggot spammed /q/ until a mod got on his side, and now r/a/dio is banned from /a/.

Kind of shitty how it's still allowed on /m/, even though all we do is just piggyback on their system, yet they can't even post threads in the board that they created said system for.

For instance, the program I used today was created entirely by one of the r/a/dio devs, for r/a/dio. And it's pretty impressive.

>If your bandwidth is slow, you might be best off having someone with fast internet record and upload.
Eh, it's good enough. If people are willing to keep the thread open some time after the radio, then they'll be able to grab it. Maybe I can link to a mediafire folder of stuff each r/m/dio so people can have access to older shows.

And it stops here.

ZOIDS was cancelled with this issue half-way completed. There was no monthly. There was no end to this series. If you want complete stories, look at the Japanese stuff.

The crew of the Celeste never got off Zoidstar.

The Corporation is sending troops to capture Zoids and bring them to Earth as war machines.

Zoidzilla is possibly dead, with no Blue Zoid capable of taking over leadership.

Red Horn is in command and genocidal.

The Namer will never see an end to the war that destroyed his planet and many others.

The rars are split into two volumes because they're too big to be uploaded onto mediafire as one rar file. Like any split archive, you have to download all of the parts in order to extract the files.

So for example,
Getter Robo Arc Volume 1.part1
Getter Robo Arc Volume 1.part2

You need both of these files to extract

That's all for tonight. My internet's acting up. And this seems like a nice cliffhanger to leave you all on.

As usual, the issues storytimed tonight will be uploaded http://www.mediafire.com/folder/5yk539mbzt8kk/Zoids They're currently uploading now, but like I said, my internet's being weird. Says it'll take forty minutes to do. I dunno.

We're pretty close to the end, so maybe I should start fishing for the next big storytime project. Or maybe I should give /m/ a rest and retire again for a few weeks/months. If I DO do another storytime, I'm willing to take suggestions, but it'll have to be a Western comic. I come to /m/ to find mech manga, you guys already look everywhere I do and you're better at finding shit.

I'm almost considering Marvel UK's run on Transformers, but /m/'s probably already read that and it'd be a hell of a long project.

Hope you enjoyed it (Though I won't blame you if you didn't. The last few issues were kind of sloppy, in my opinion).

Tomorrow, by request, Marvel Comics (UK branch) presents ZOIDS! Which I've never read, but it seems to be a toy line/game system or something. I dunno, it's giant sentient robot animals or something and predates the anime by about twenty years or so. Should be fun.

REVENGE OF THE SHOGUN WARRIORS
Thundernon Thu Sep 05 2013 12:52:32 No.9595347 ViewReport	
LAST TIME ON SHOGUN WARRIORS:
A giant preying mantis from space showed up out of nowhere and killed the Followers of the Light! Now, with no tech support or guidance from the benevolent group, the Shogun Warriors are on their own. But at least they managed to wrap up a loose end from Marvel's Godzilla series, right?

Will they turn to SHIELD, the world's anti-espionage organization? The Fantastic Four? Maybe the Avengers?

No, instead they're gonna hide their robots where some punk kid can find one and pilot it. This sounds like the opening scene to an anime. Possibly even to one of the shows the comic takes the mechs from.

This is the last page. This was originally a joint project between Dynamic Pro Scanlations and Bite Me Scanlations. There was a big fight and cooperation ceased between both parties. So no, there are no other chapters scanlated. The original mediafire link is down due to copyright infringement. So you'll only get it in this thread.

Okay, so eight out of twenty issues in one day. Not bad, I guess. We've got twelve more, so about two days unless I double up on a day. Which I probably won't.

So, /m/, what'd you think? Would you read more?

Personally, I think the dialogue's still iffy, but I've read worse and it's got a bit of charm to it.

SHOGUN WARRIORS
Thundernon Tue Sep 03 2013 15:51:03 No.9586991 ViewReport	
Quoted By: >>9591647
Hi, /m/. Did you miss me?

As promised after I did ROM, I bring you the SHOGUN WARRIORS.

A bit of history: In the 1970s Mattel somehow got their hands on a bunch of anime and decided to make toys of them. The robots they got were renamed and poorly made by today's standards, requiring disassembly for transformations and sometimes even parts from other toys that weren't released in America.

In 1979, perhaps after seeing the success of ROM, GREATEST OF THE SPACEKNIGHTS, Mattel approached Marvel about doing a comic book series based on three of the Shogun Warriors: Raydeen, Combattra, and Dangard Ace. Marvel agreed and a 20-issue story followed.

So here we go.

Oh, and if you missed ROM, all of his comics are up in http://www.mediafire.com/folder/1ivvjpjjvcl7o/ROM

MSV-R Return of Johnny Ridden ch 16
Nozaku Mon Sep 02 2013 16:16:03 No.9582170 ViewReport	
Here is chapter 16 for Return of Johnny Ridden. The previous translations appeared to be from Gundam Ace, whereas this one was the final chapter from volume 3, so included are cover pages, extras, etc. A big thanks to AngryAnon for the scans.

http://www.mediafire.com/download/h9hxa4yktk13vc8/Mobile_Suit_Gundam_MSV-R_Johnny_Raiden_no_Kikan_v3ch16.zip

This update was a single chapter to finish off volume 3 but expect future updates for MSV-R to be in volumes (that take more time to prepare). (oh and I know "Raiden" is misspelled in the file names before someone mentions it, it's just too much work to fix every individual file name at this point).

So, I have 3 weeks before I leave to Japan. I am still looking for kind /m/en who are willing to help me with shopping (cleaning, blanking and text-shopping) and uploading while I'm there for a year.

Also, while I'm in Japan, are there any (single-volume) mangas I should be on the lookout for?

A few days after the birth of the last 80's and 70's mecha thread, the feared moment finally arrived: The image limit have been reached.

Speaking of which, I found all of Akiba S1 on youtube, but season 2 doesn't appear to exist anywhere. I can't torrent so I may be a little fucked.
Any thoughts? Anyone have a mediafire for these?

the return of the 70's & 80's Mecha Thread
Anonymous Fri Aug 23 2013 10:08:24 No.9535324 ViewReport	
A few weeks ago, the 70's & 80's mecha thread got pruned after a long inactivity, and as it didn't have any successor no, one ever heard of it again... But now, it is time for the new 70's & 80's mecha thread to take his place and shine!

For those of you who don't know what to do in this thread, here are some things you can do: argue, discuss and dump stuff like artworks, fanarts (if they're well made of course), sketches, magazines' scans, artbooks, DVD/VHS/LD/CD/BD's covers, ads, musics, screencaps and so on, that have a link to a Sci-Fi and Mecha anime/comic/novel/film/OVA.

He's about 36 now. He's a fairly famous voice actor too. Off the top of my head he was Kane in Bodacious Space Pirates, Blues in Rockman.EXE, Matsuba (Morty) in Pokemon, Ballad Hunter in Zoids New Century, and, the best one, Pirihiko Ichimonji in Zettai Hero Project for the PSP. As for Sentai, besides Mega, he was in Hurricanger as one of Shurikenger's disguises, he was the previous Lord in Shinkenger, and he was Gokumaru in Go-Onger.

Here's a nice video of him breaking into other voice actors hotel rooms, waking them up, and seeing how long it takes for them to say a line of one of their characters.

And here's a medley of songs from a VA medley album. There's some familiar songs in here, especially the very last one.

Use dice for everything. For storys have a pre-established plot line and have the game master introduce conflict between characters, reward players for having characters with backgrounds that specify unique personality and life style traits, ala, specifying your character is an alcoholic with bounty hunters after him because he crashed his ship into a mafia wedding on accident years ago or what have you.

Model your RP after established, high quality RPG systems that have been tried and put to the test. Adapting mecha, robot skills and so on is simple and shouldn't be much trouble.

Tried and true DnD is a good option, if you're looking for something online friendly and a bit more simple, try The Returners, it's an excellent RP system originally made for final fantasy but easily adjustable for /m/ format. You can find the core book here:
http://www.mediafire.com/view/?xaw5istqdhjc1ch

Remember, a competent game master with a -DETAILED PLAN- FOR THE RP'S PLOT AND ACTIVITIES, with a focus on story telling is KEY. "5 Zakus appear. Roll for initiative." is absolute utter shit.

"As you pass through the massive ship graveyard, you are all rocked back by the force of a nearby derelict ship erupting into a brilliant explosion. As your eyes adjust from the blinding flash of light, the form of several Zaku space type mobile suits rocket from behind the shattered carcass of the dead Starship. The leader of the enemy squadron points his Zaku's atuo-cannon at you and prepares to fire... Roll for initiative...." - THIS is how you narrate NPC combat. Structure, setting, plot. Those three things = good times.

Ok, this one is kinda complicated.
I would like to request Wild Flowers instrumental version from SRW OE, but it's only 128bps (R/a/dio folks like it higher), but it's quite clear, you can test it beforehand.
And it's 7 minutes long, but it loops so you can fade it out after 2-3minutes I think.

Yeah, here they are incase you don't feel like looking.

Still never managed to take shots of the second book. I'll get around to it eventually but Solatorobo threads never go well in /v/ and the camera flash and double-paged spreads kind of muck things up. I took shots of almost all of the artwork, the rest of the book is text heavy lore. About 50 pages worth in each book.

Definitely worth getting if you're a fan. A lot easier getting them now than when I got them. You can apparently order them right off of Amazon.co.jp and they'll ship internationally.

It's a 1 volume comedy manga that was published in a 4koma magazine that sorta takes the piss out of AO. For example, when Truth shows up, everyone ignores him completely until he just floats away.

I'm going to put it to you straight. There isn't any animated BT except for a saturday morning cartoon in the '90s. The main way you get the universe is by reading the books that have been coming out for 30 years. I'm not going to lie, it's not for everyone. It's hard to get started, honestly. But it's damn cool, because no other fictional work is quite this detailed.
>>>/tg/26583092 knows more about it than I

And that's it.

For the last time, all issues are at http://www.mediafire.com/folder/1ivvjpjjvcl7o/ROM

ROM would appear again when Rick Jones was married, as a guest at the wedding.

There was a shortlived series in the 2000s where ROM, now Prime Director of Galador and renamed Artour, appeared. The ship he was on was destroyed, yet no body was ever found. This would be the last time he ever made an appearance.

The Spaceknights continued, though they may all be dead now thanks to Hickman's need to treat everyone like Worf to show how tough his new villains are.

If /m/ likes, I'll continue tomorrow with Marvel's SHOGUN WARRIORS. It really depends on if /m/ wants to read about the adventures of Combattra, Dangaurd Ace, and Raydeen. If you want it, ask.

Until then, though... Well, I hope you enjoyed the series.

VICTORY! With the aid of the heroes of Earth, and Beta Ray Bill, ROM has exterminated the Dire Wraith threat on Earth! And, further, he has destroyed the source of their foul magics, rendering any survivors across the galaxy utterly powerless to carry out their schemes! Truly, ROM is the greatest of the Spaceknights.

ROM 12: The Reboot
Thundernon Sat Aug 03 2013 14:39:48 No.9448398 ViewReport	
Quoted By: >>9452581
The last time we left ROM, Brandy Clark, in the body of Starshine, was growing worse. She had lost the humanity that ROM loved her for and became more like his old friend, the Terminator. However, the half Dire Wraith mutant known as Hybrid stripped her of her armor, her power, and turned her into a human for the purpose of bearing his children! With the aid of the New Mutants, ROM was able to stop his plan, but Brandy's injuries were critical.

Meanwhile, SHIELD and the UN have been cracking down on Dire Wraith activity throughout the world. There are very few left, but now the Wraiths have activated their final plan for victory...

Can ROM: GREATEST OF THE SPACEKNIGHTS foil their fiendish plan? Will he finally end his two hundred year old war? Or is ROM going to meet with more disappointment?

Come and see the final chapters of ROM: SPACEKNIGHT, under the talented pens of Bill Mantlo and Steve Ditko. We are at issue 61 of 75.

Picking up at ROM 57.

Last time on ROM, everyone they knew in Clairton had been killed. Brandy, now possessing the body and power of Starshine: SPACEKNIGHT went way off the fucking deep end. The Spaceknights finally revealed the war with the Wraiths to the world and, after consulting the UN, the Earth declared war. President Reagan assigned ROM control over Earth's armies against the Wraiths, due to his experience and the fact that the other heroes were missing (Actually they were going through the first Secret War). Rick Jones is dying of cancer.

Let me apologize for my lack of presence. It's been a hard time at work. Still, I'm back, if exhausted, and I'm ready to bring you...

ROM! GREATEST OF THE SPACEKNIGHTS!

The last time we left ROM, Brandy had been given the body and powers of Starshine, Spaceknight of Galador and the Wielder of the Living Light, through Dire Wraith sorcery.

The females of the Dire Wraiths turned on and executed the males for their incompetence and reliance on technology over sorcery. Following this, they returned to the town of Clairton and murdered most of the population. The female Dire Wraiths don't just assume the forms like their male counterparts had, they jab their tongues into their victim's brain, suck out their memory and life force, and leave nothing but a dried husk behind.

Their treachery revealed, much of Clairton was destroyed in the purge that followed. Most of the population was dead. In her grief, Brandy cast aside any illusions of her remaining humanity and transformed into a golden gladiatrix to wreak havoc upon the aliens that destroyed her life.

And now we join them again, fresh from the tragedy.

Oh and, as always, all previous issues have been uploaded to http://www.mediafire.com/folder/1ivvjpjjvcl7o/ROM

Alright guys, heading out for the week. Should be back on Tuesday so don't expect anything till at least Thursday.

For now he's the last I've done. Don't expect a whole lot of changes. I also can't say it's without error because there was a lot of late night work done on it.

Oh no sorry for the misunderstanding. What I meant by the parentheses was how many volumes the series was. So No legacy yet. But your vote is noted.

I've done CHar's CounterAttack: Beyond the Time (2 vols, about Nanai).
V Gundam Sidestory (short 100pgs)
First 2 vol.s of Gundam Thoroughbred. (doing the last 3rd vol next)

I'm guessing you want the links? (sry, just making sure before I spam up the thread)

Yeah, I know, I need a website. I'll try to make some basic free one soon.

Mobile suits were a revolutionary machine, especially as a weapon during the One Year War. But how did they come into being? One small inconspicuous factory's fate becomes intertwined with the creation of mobile suits years before the war.

(as usual, stick in the dots)

I know I shouldn't be posting this at bloody 2 am but I always end up working a long stretch, burning myself out and wanting to just post the volume and be done with it. So here you are. Feel free to point out any mistakes or areas in need of improvement.

Next after this will be the 3rd and final volume of Thoroughbred (the "what if" volume).
Let's decide a next series for me to pick up. I'm looking at either Gundam Legacy (3 vol) or Gundam Senki 0081 (4 vol).

I am still looking for people willing to help with photoshopping when I leave to Japan in less than 2 months. I won't be able to shop and upload while there. I would only be able to send scripts.

Hello friends.

I recently upsized a poster I saw people in this thread looking for. It's currently a 34x22 I believe, 300 DPI (print res). It is sized up from a smaller file so it's not perfect, but I did what I could to reduce the compression artifacts and blurry garbage.

Download for the full res:

I absolutely hate how TV-N likes to pretend they're helping people learn Japanese with their crap subs but never do anything to actually aid people in it (like making fucking soft subs, for starters).

While cleaning out some old files on my computer I found these, which are the original Japanese captions for the shows, and I thought they might help some people out if they're actually trying to learn Japanese.
As they are they don't synch with O-T's raws (don't know about BunnyHat's), but you can use http://subshifter.bitsnbites.eu/ this site to re-synch them to fit any raw you might have.

Okay, I added Bring's latest suggestions so here's the batch of event dialogue for all stages up to 10b QC'd (let's just hope I didn't mess up and save an older version or anything). That's just the text files, though I included batches for each stage so it should be simple to generate the textures with the tool so we can put them together with Dash's battle dialogues and Steve's menu stuff for the first big batch.

I also included stages 01 to 02b of the male/super route (the files/folders tagged with "MS"), which I translated a while ago from the textures ripped by Guy G. I think we probably shouldn't include those in this batch though, since explaining how to avoid the conflicts would cause confusion that's not worth it for so little material.

Hey /m/! A while ago I asked for eps 1-9 of Dragonar that GARlock subbed (he disappeared a while ago and his uploads are all gone), and a bro was kind enough to upload these:

http://www.mediafire.com/folder/1yy119f1s1xaf/Dragonar_sub

Then a couple nights ago I asked if anyone had 8 or 9, and I think a bro did, but I had to go to sleep and when I woke up the thread was gone ;_; Dragonarbro, are you still around? Sorry for missing you. If anyone else has Garlock's 8 or 9 subbed that'd be great. Having those handy might be helpful in an attempt to pick up subbing this again. Thanks for your time and sorry for the trouble!

All right, for those who weren't in-thread, we noticed that AnimeSols a shit and marketing failures, what with nobody knowing about them without at least knowing someone who knows about them. Now, we don't want to suffer for their shity PR scheme, we want quality shows. So, much to the pleasure of my fellow man, I took it upon myself to rip the Yatterman and New Yatterman episodes they have. Hopefully later on down the line, we can have the scripts and someone can work with raws, but for now, this is the best we've got. I'm still in the process of uploading New Yatter, and I still need to rip the TV Specials, then I'll move on to Tekkaman and Tobikage.

I wonder if anybody would be interested in translating any of these. My Japanese is decent enough to more or less read them, but I can't even think of translating...

I just tried that. Twice, and I still get that dumb string of letters and numbers. What's more, not all of the files are uploaded into the .torrent. Somehow a few episodes got deleted or some shit, so now I have to re-download them. No big deal, though. I'll see if I can't mediafire them or somethin

OK well all item names are done.
Many of the descriptions are done (Some are a little odd).
A couple of pilots are done but I don't know why half of them didn't take. I tried to do as many as I could tonight but for some reason many of them (TTGL and MSG crew) didn't take. I'll have to look into it further tomorrow.

What do you need the tracklist for? If it's to find the songs, you can just grab the soundtrack from here:

http://www.mediafire.com/?soj9o4sma79fojh

If it's about getting the names of the songs, well, you can wait for them to be translated in the game.

>>9391830
Pretty much like a classic SRW (like J, for example) but now robots have components ala Front Mission (head, body, arms, legs) that can be destroyed individually to cause different penalties on units and CAPTURE them for use or sell.

No squads, no pilot point customization, no branching paths (but you have subscenarios that can be played over and over), no SR points. Read the FAQ for more details (in gamefaqs).

Also, I don't think this is the thread to look for someone to sprite pacific rim bots, please try somewhere else.

>Hey you asshole, where's our storytime been?

Sorry about that. Buddy of mine got married and I spent all day Friday travelling to Vermont to party with him and bang his wife one last time, Saturday actually doing wedding shit, and most of today trying to get over the hangover. Shit sucks, man.

But I'm back now, and ROM can continue!

We last left ROM as shit was going down. Doctor Dredd had turned Brandy into the Starknight Starshine with Dire Wraith hoodoo, while ROM fought off a Dire Wraith sorcerer who'd been posing as the Pied Piper of Hamlin in order to kidnap children and take them to Wraithworld! Now ROM is trapped on the other side of a mystical portal while Steve and Torpedo are at the mercy of a Dire Warlock and his mind-controlled Spaceknight!

Shit's pretty fuckin easy to patch. Just BE SURE you have a Clean ISO. Also DO NOT DELETE YOUR ORIGINAL ISO. EVER.
You'll need it for future patches.
Also note this is V0.01 so there might be some issues/grammatical shit and other problems. Not even CLOSE to everything is done or properly translated so no complaining about that.

However I am open to criticisms and assistance so I'm always down for stuff like that.

ROM! GREATEST OF THE SPACEKNIGHTS! The Silver Guardian of Galador, turned into an immortal cyborg in order to fight off the foul Dire Wraiths, has finally freed the town of Clairton of their vile menace. The cost, however, was high. With grief in his heart, he left to purge Earth of the alien menace posed by his foes.

His travels have taken him to Scotland and then to Atlantis, where he has teamed up with Namor to battle his sorcerous foes.

Armed with his mighty Neutralizer, a device capable of neutralizing any energy and banishing the Dire Wraiths to eternal torment in the hell-dimension of Limbo, he continues his two century war against his sworn enemies.

For those just joining that, we're storytiming a 1980s series about ROM! GREATEST OF THE SPACEKNIGHTS! To battle an alien menace invading his home planet of Galador, ROM became the first Spaceknight, a cyborg warrior armed with weapons to detect and banish the Dire Wraiths across the universe.

Two hundred years later, he has come to Earth to purge it of their evil.

Sorry about the lateness, folks. Busy night.

You know the drill. Previous thread is >>9351881, all previous issues are http://www.mediafire.com/?1ivvjpjjvcl7o

For those just joining us, we're 26 issues into the saga of ROM: SPACEKNIGHT. An alien from the planet Galador, Rom was the first volunteer to undergo cybernetic transformation into ROM! GREATEST OF THE SPACEKNIGHTS! in order to fight the deadly Dire Wraiths, shapeshifting masters of evil, sorcery, and science. Having defended Galador from their threat, Rom spent 200 years banishing their race to the hell-dimension of Limbo, where none can die, slaughtering them wherever he could find them. Including Earth. He spent some time there, only to return to Galador over a vision received from Limbo. And with good timing, as he found not only an imposter, but Galactus as well...

So Santa and I decided that since I actually have a mic, that I should actually do some of my own buffers and introductions and the like.

The music's first and foremost though- so I'll make sure that always takes precedence. My mic's a bit shitty too, so even more reason not to spam it. Still, if you guys don't like what I try today, let me know and I can change it or stop it.

Cold, man.

This ends today's ROM thread. Tomorrow, I've got work until about 7:30 PM EST. I'll do a thread, but it'll be VERY late. I know we've got some Britfags who skim these, so you guys may need to check the Catalog when y'all wake up.

Next storytime will bring ROM: HERALD OF GALACTUS, ROM's triumphant return to Earth, and an encounter with the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants! I hope you enjoy this and the previous threads.

As always, the issues for today and all past issues have been uploaded to the Mediafire link found in OP.

ROM! LEADER OF THE METAL GLADIATORS OF GALADOR!

In 1979, a rather shitty toy came out. But amongst fans of Marvel Comics, he grew to be a legend.

Continuing where I left off yesterday, ROM has convinced the town of Clairton that he's not a retarded evil robot who kills for kicks. But will the world trust him?

ROM! GREATEST OF THE SPACEKNIGHTS!

Introduced in 1979 as a comic based on a rather craptacular toy! Brought to /m/ yesterday!

The Galadorian hero, transformed into a cybernetic super-warrior to fight off the evil Dire Wraiths! He has come to Earth and finds himself feared by the very people he wishes to protect, no thanks to the shapeshifting monsters he faces now.

When last we left our hero, he had wrecked a Dire Wraith funeral, slaying all he could in order to find his greatest weapon, the Neutralizer! However, they summoned the monstrous Deathwing, which knocked ROM into the depths of an unknown cave system. But our hero may not be alone...

Vol 2
http://www.mediafire.com/download/9z8q2064hzq3x9y/Fantasy_World_Jun_Volume_2.rar

This is a beautiful manga, some of the most amazing art Shotaro Ishinomori has ever done. It's a manga really about storytelling, about loss, about life and about the world as a whole, one I'm told he did when coping with the loss of his sister. Hence the theme of sorrow and how it's part of life.

Jun Vol.2
http://www.mediafire.com/download/9z8q2064hzq3x9y/Fantasy_World_Jun_Volume_2.rar

What an honor it was to work on this with our friend Guren. It's one of the most poignant, beautiful manga I've ever had the honor of working on. Jun's journey continues, taking him to beautiful new worlds, through amazing experiences and a quest to uncover the meaning of art, life, loss and sorrow.

This has my vote as THE manga of Shotaro Ishinomori with the exception of The Way Of Ryu. It's worth the price of admission just to see the art.

Enjoy, everyone.

When you read this, I just want everyone to keep in mind the tragedies Shotaro Ishinomori suffered, and the sheer work he put into this. The man was rightly known as the King of manga and he gave us an incredible archive to enjoy. It's a tragedy he's no longer with us, but nobody can live forever. I think Jun represents the man's work better than almost anything else he has done. As a scanlator, I love bringing his works out in English to people who would never enjoy them, and I find myself fascinated reading his thoughts and seeing his brilliance on the panels.

He wrote so many great stories and created characters that live on even after him. Robot Detective Keiji. Ryu. Kikaider. The 9 Cyborgs. Ichi the blind swordsman....while Tezuka was fond of writing himself into his own stories, to my knowledge, Jun is Shotaro's only avatar. Here we get to see his inner thoughts and the sheer beauty of his art, especially the color pages at the end.

In the end, I want to say that the world is better because of Shotaro Ishinomori's devotion to his art and he left us a great deal to enjoy. Thank you, Sensei. Long live the King.

First draft of the script was leaked a while ago. A lot of the elements are retained - Mako having a dead co-pilot, the Kaiju names, Hunnam's general character and other things - but there are some major differences. For one, there's only two named Jaegers in the film by the time the main story begins, Gypsy Danger and Tacit Ronin. Eureka, Alpha and Typhoon don't even exist, and Coyote Tango was formerly piloted by Raleigh and his brother instead of Danger. Pentecost also doesn't pilot, and there are a few other characters like a friend of Newt's and a crazy Russian scientist who didn't make it into the final cut.

I bought the Blu-Ray edition and it came with a 56-pages manga explaining what happened between the last volume of the manga and this movie. The best part is that the manga was made on Ishinomori's style rather than the movie redesign.

But I can't read japanese to tell exactly what happened, but there's a translated preview here:

Here's stage 11 (female/real). It's nice to translate something new again. I haven't had time to test these textures in the game myself, but they should work just the same as all the others.

By the way. Bring always gives me the base text files so I can just fill in the translation, and most of them work fine, but there's always some that give me this "Number of lines is not multiple of 10" error when I try to open them in the Dialogue Editor. This time it happened to a lot of them. It's not an issue since I can easily generate the files myself with the Texture Organizer, but it would be nice to know why this happens. Also, there was one scene that didn't include the text file and I couldn't generate it because some of the textures were messed up (I guess something happened while dumping?), so I had to input the filenames manually. It was a short scene of only like 3 or 4 lines though, so it wasn't a big deal.

Yep. Kind of. It's a weird stand alone thing where a human sized gynoid minerva X keeps hopping alternate realities to find that doesn't have a bad end with Kouji and mazinger destroying earth. Aside some odd things like Kouji being a jeeg like cyborg, she finally finds one that's like our classic Kouji and a good end happens.


Till the great general of darkness shows up in the sequel. That guy ruins everything.

Mobile Suit Gundam Sidestory: A Place Beyond the Blaze Vol. 2. (Aka Gundam Thoroughbred). Thanks to S-rank for the scans and blanking the volume.

http://www mediafire com/download/shwfcrva4cyw0fw/Gundam_Thoroughbred-From_a_Place_Beyond_the_Blaze-_Vol_2.rar

(As is the norm, fill in the dots.)
I don't know why I didn't include them them in the first volume but I threw in the mechanical files (untranslated, shoot me, I was lazy) for vol 1 and 2 in this volume.

One final 3rd volume to go. the last one is a "what if" volume. But before that, since I like to alternate between series, I'll put out Mobile Suit Developers next.

One more housekeeping issue I'd like to bring up. If all goes well, I'll be in Japan for a year starting this October. I still want to continue translating stuff but you /m/en already know about Japan's strict downloading/uploading laws. I will not dare upload or download anything while I'm there and this complicates things, as i can't upload finished work and can't download new scans. Therefore, I was wondering if there are any willing souls out there that I can send text files to for text-shopping.
(I think s-rank is already onboard?)
We can figure out small details later.

Also, if there is no good way for me to get new scans to work on besides downloading, the next best thing to do is to just have them with me if/when I go. So if you /m/en have any requests, now (within these next 3 months) would be the time to get me these scans so I have something to do for the year there.

Happy Scans released Ishinomori's Fantasy World Jun some days ago. Here's the link:

http://www.mediafire.com/download/ypt8gadl0vzg3nr/Fantasy_World_Jun_volume_1.rar

Holy shit this was absolutely incredible. It's about an aspiring mangaka and his wild imagination. It doesn't have much of a story or even text, it's mostly just brilliant imaginative artwork flowing together in an abstract dreamlike way.

It's a manga really about storytelling, about loss, about life and about the world as a whole, one I'm told he did when coping with the loss of his sister. Hence the theme of sorrow and how it's part of life.

And here is an amusing bit of relevant 60's mangaka drama that I stole from the comments of the Happy Scans website:

"Actually, Jun won the Shogakukan Manga Award, Tezuka got jealous because it was competing with his life work, Hi no Tori, published on the same magazine. Being asked by a fan, he said that Jun was not a great example of the art of manga.

Apparently, Ishinomori was so offended by this statement that he almost canceled Jun at the time. But after that, Tezuka personally asked forgiveness to Ishinomori and as good admirer and follower of the great master, he accepted the apology and continued to publish the work.

Tezuka was very competitive and envious of the talent of others, and clearly Ishinomori was proving to have it in abundance. He also attacked Shigeru Mizuki saying that he has not drawing skills and the fact that he lost his left arm (Mizuki was left-handed) has nothing to do with it since there's nothing that the human body cannot accomplish with willpower. He also said that he could do better horror stories any time he wants.

Yeah, Tezuka was hardly the Mr. Nice Guy he's usually portrayed as."

Quick guide on how to use: download Dolphin emulator version 3.0 (it must be this version) and install. In the graphics settings, set texture cache all the way to "safe" and enable "load custom textures". Download the translated stuff from the Mediafire folder above and put the textures in Dolhpin's main folder\User\Load\Textures\GRWJD9\ (create this folder if it doesn't exist). You don't need to worry about the text files if you're just an end user.

The tools used in this translation (along with the big pdf) can be found here:

General progress? The dialogue's been translated up to mission 10, menus are finished up to mission 9, and battle lines are up to 8, I think. Last I heard, the male MC translations were done up to mission 2. We'll probably release a complete pack for everything that's finished once everyone's caught up to mission 10 (That was the original plan, right?).

You have to rename them obviously to match the file names of the rips and put them in the same folder. But keep the .ass extension.

I guess that's what happened, then. I've been using v1.4c for a while now, but I don't remember which version I was using when I did stage 6. Must have been an old one.

Anyway. I didn't have an old version of file 06.05, but I was able to remake it rather easily since I still had the base text file Bring gave me and the translated textures installed in the emulator, so it was just a matter transcribing it back. I've uploaded the stage again with the correct 06.05 if Bring wants to QC it. It already has the other fixes we've discussed.

LEGEND OF THE UNIVERSAL CENTURY HEROES
MOBILE SUIT GUNDAM MSV-R
THE FABULOUS SHIN MATSUNAGA [FABULOUS-W1]

There was once a man called the White Wolf of Solomon. A man who was even said to be the right hand man of Vice Admiral Dozle Zabi, the commander of the Principality of Zeon’s Space Assault Force. The year 0079 of the Universal Century was a year painted with death and destruction, all in the name of Zeon’s war for independence. So how did that man live through those times? This is the story that traces his paths…

>How does this work
Please read the first post.

>what are you supposed to download
If you just want the translated lines, get the translated textures packs from the mediafire folder and the (few) ones that have been released in this thread (use the search function of your browser to find "dropbox" and "medifire") and the fixes.

>do the new downloads have the fixes already applied
If you're asking if the packs for stage 06 and 07 have weird jumps, I can't tell you for sure. I've been extra careful with those (and even modified the tools to automatically avoid the problem in a lot of cases -but not all) and they should be mostly ok...

BUT, there's a problem with ALL battle dialogues that have more than 1 line. The carriage return counts as an extra texture, and has a different hash than the texture with the full line(s) even though it has the exact same content. There's no way of telling which one of those should go first and second, so the only way of telling if the line is fine is by seeing it happen translated in-game... which in most cases is a RANDOM thing.

tl;dr; There's going to be more fixes in the future. Period.

DO YOU LIKE MECHS? IS THERE SOMETHING SEXY ABOUT MASSIVE BIPEDAL MACHINES RIPPING EACHOTHER APART? DO YOU ENJOY YOUR MACHINE BEING ONE-SHOT BY AIRCRAFT LAUNCHED MUNITIONS? YOU BET YOUR DAMN ASS YOU DO. READ ON.

Yep, it's about that time. About a year and a half ago I unveiled rules-light mech RPG for /tg/, seeing as how there wasn't a easy, real-robot system out there. It's been met with favorable responses over the months. Today I present to you 0.9.84, which has a huge heap of new content. There's a few placeholder texts left over, and there might be a typo here and there, but it's solid enough to present. Of particular note is the new Prime, Beico, which offers all sorts of fun, like efficient-minded parts and missile goodness.

New Beico parts added, the setting has been heavily updated, aircraft and country-specific mechs have been created, etc. The WARGAME portion of ChromeStrike (Yes, you can run the game as a wargame, with like twenty plus vehicles to a side) is also being worked on. This edition gets a call-out to Bludhawk, who has been hugely responsible for the updated fluff and new mechs, plus backgrounds.

There's a lot to talk about this edition, but it'd be great to get general feedback and queries. Let us know your thoughts.

Bleugh, finally school and Fanime is over and I got time to crank this out. So there you have it, V Gundam Sidestory.

Uso, while out on patrol, is ambushed but then wakes on a strange ship headed to an even stranger colony. Meanwhile, Zanscare discovers a new superweapon. Both Zanscare and young Uso will both make shocking discoveries.

it's goofy subs for Mazinger Z (or other shows) from pirate DVDs that take the japanese dialog, translate it to chinese, then to English.

They're usually less insane in the context of the show. Like "increase the soup" is followed by a knob or a dial or a beam increasing. They're more enjoyable in the show.
http://anime.thehylia.com/downloads/series/devilman is for Devilman, they also had Mazinger last time I checked.

The "chanchachaan" is actually in the line too. Changing it for "ta-dah!" is possible, but it not only is a bit too short in comparison, but also feels kind of weird to read it like that when it's so clearly spoken... just my opinion, though.

The other part is a little play on the "Elvis has left / entered the building". Using "arrived on the scene" would actually be closer to the original, but I think the comedy effect is lost there.

>>9158988

Well the thread on /y maxed out and my mediafire account was TOS'd so I'll just crosspost later so I don't spam or hijack rhis thread... but i'll re-up there later tonight. I was going to make a scanlation/collection archive [UC80.1] with other anon but we havent contacted translator yet.

I can add those human Keroro doujins too...

Maybe some trap!tieria? idk what /m wants?


Um. If you didnt know though, there is a huge difference between BL doujin and Hentai doujin... Emphasis isnt really on dix or penetration like most hentai... t's more ero face, ass, chest, fingers and drama. Just warning.

You'll have to be patient, we're still editing the first 10 scenarios. And our main editor happens to be the main dialogue dumper... and the one managing the mediafire folder... and is *very* busy with his job as well.

On other news, I "solved" the problem of the text jumping back and forth in the middle of battle dialogues. Turns out I was wrong and it wasn't a case of files having the same size, but files having the *wrong* size.

To understand what I mean, you can check the files in this zip, compare them and wonder why one is bigger than the other (I honestly have no idea):

https://www.dropbox.com/s/6sq8y2ybdd74738/wtf%20sizes.zip

Now the Texture Organizer and the Battle Dialogue Editor make a second pass when ordering them and avoid the problem. In case anybody wants the new versions, you can grab them from here:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/mjd6ekmqd69nc79/SRW_GC_Texture_Organizer_v1.2e.zip

https://www.dropbox.com/s/8flhcs2w52ius9m/SRW_GC_Battle_Editor_v1.2f.zip

I couldn't implement the bitwise comparisons between images, but this fix won't mean a noticeable slowdown so I guess it's ok.

I'll keep my eyes open to find the lines that were broken before, but if you find any feel free to say it.

After a grueling amount of work, the second partial patch for MLAF is here. This patch covers the Birthday, Onsen, and Christmas arcs, as well as the introductory portion of the Beach arc. This covers approximately 65% of the game.

You may be thrilled to note that the translation no longer requires the use of AralTrans, and hopefully that will relieve some of the headaches everyone's been having.

Enjoy!

Backland Stride: An Armored Core/Zone of the Enders/Star Trek inspired Game
Anonymous Fri May 03 2013 20:56:46 No.9068867 ViewReport	
After a few months of development and playtesting, the first version of Backland Stride is here!
http://www.mediafire.com/?2zd4pb326zglx16

Okay, maybe I'm getting ahead of myself here. Backland Stride is a Roleplaying Game co-developed by me and a friend, designed specifically for roleplaying mercenaries inspired by Armored Core's Ravens who pilot one of a kind high powered machines, known here as Runners and Stride Armors respectively.

Oh yeah, and it's mecha creation/customization is pretty detailed yet simple to get the hang of. And the entire thing has the air of a soft science fiction TV Show like Star Trek, including Green Skinned space chicks and Ctarl-Ctarl.

There's an IRC channel for the game too, #BacklandStride on irc.rizon.net

Shhh... let them sleep.

Well, some things were uploaded shortly before the demise of the last thread and some people may have missed them. I'll post the links here:

- Steve's 3rd batch of menu pack, which makes pretty much everything up to stage 7 look nicer:

http://www.mediafire.com/?ot7qd1lv8qv3r2m

- Male / Super dialogues from stages 1 - 2b, dumped and sorted by Guy G. and translated by Oppai:

Stage 01 male/super lines: mediafire.com/?zvgspg8ehk8vv1n

Stage 02 male/super lines: mediafire.com/?bakc9hhsi4fzo5c

Stage 02b male/super lines: mediafire.com/?n8anpa3aeau3s61

There's also pastebin links and mediafire links to sorted but untranslated files, which I won't post as I think Oppai and Guy have access to them and I don't think they will be of use to anybody else.

- Translated intro as seen in OP's picture (still needs some work, graphics editors are welcome on this):

https://www.dropbox.com/s/02m7xb6zdnzzdce/edited%20intro.7z

Bring, if you have the time, please upload these to the mediafire folder... Or maybe it is possible for somebody else to do it? I don't have a mediafire account so I don't know how it works, and I feel bad about troubling you with this...


- Finally, the tools used in this translation (along with the big pdf) can be found here:

http://www.romhacking.net/utilities/940/

Should you want to:

a) help
b) translate the game to another language
c) insert joke translations (like the Milky Tits saga or the MSG Abridged dialogues)

then grab the toolkit, read the pdf and do what you may.

Quick guide on how to use: download Dolphin emulator version 3.0 (it must be this version) and install. In the graphics settings, set texture cache all the way to "safe" and enable "load custom textures". Download the translated stuff from the Mediafire folder above and put the textures in Dolhpin's main folder\User\Load\Textures\GRWJD9\ (create this folder if it doesn't exist). You don't need to worry about the text files if you're just an end user.

Feedback is appreciated.

Stage 02b male/super lines: mediafire.com/?n8anpa3aeau3s61

Like before, just put the textures in the same folder where you have the female/real textures and overwrite whatever. I am preparing complete folders for both versions, to make it simpler later when we release a batch.

Guy, you missed the white and grey versions of one of Akimi's lines in stage 02. No big deal though, I just dumped those two textures myself.

Also, I do believe we just went over the bump limit again.

It features 39 out of 70 cards from the first set. LackeyCCG supports online games so you can also try and play with someone, there are enough cards for building a somewhat decent Zyuranger deck, so give it a shot.

I'll be heading to bed, if this thread is still active I'll continue tomorrow with some more cards. Good night.

Just dump the textures in the same directory where you have the female/real textures and say yes when it asks if you want to overwrite anything (back up the old textures first, of course). It should work.

DO BIPEDAL GUN PLATFORMS STRIKE A CHORD WITHIN YOUR SOUL? DO YOU LIKE MECHS? DO YOU ALSO LIKE RASHES AND JUNGLE FEVER? DO YOU LIKE YOUR MECH BREAKING DOWN AND YOUR CHARACTER DYING OF MALARIA AND DEHYDRATION? Actually you probably don't. That's okay.

ChromeStrike time. About a year and a half ago I unveiled a rules-light mech RPG for you folks, seeing as how there wasn't a easy, real-robot system out there. It's been met with favorable responses over the months, and contributions and brainstormings from /tg/ have helped shape it into something pretty nifty. Just this week my idea-guys have bashed heads together to come up with a South American prime corp; Emerald Gardens. This release mostly contains their background and various parts, plus a few additional weapon types.

Today I present 0.9.82, which was actually mostly done by other folks then myself. Let's have a moment of thankful silence for my people, and then move on to the EG mechs- the all-terrain, semi-amphibious machines that actually survive and thrive in jungle environments. I've also got some ideas under wraps for the Opposing Forces expansion, and may or may not do a Space Opera expansion some time in the future also.

Goal this thread is general feedback and observations, complaints, the normal. Gimme.

Oh you know, come to think of it, it might be because of the mediafire link. I tried to link to a file on mediafire last week and my comments were not posting. Try this instead.

If you don't mind, could you also make a note for a few more things in the description like:
1.) Raw is from Simu #415114
2.) This is an OCR of the old hardsubbed dubtitle found on bakabt.
3.) Timings are not perfect but they were well enough for most episodes other than 4&5 which have been fixed.
Just the subs:

Also, I don't know if nyaa automatically links to a torrent with the same ID when you put #415114 or if you have to use bbcode like [URL=address]#415114[/URL].

Robot Keiji is back and we wrap up the Stork murder story. Thanks to Sonickrazy as always for translating this Ishinmori classic, so in appreciation you should go check out his blog here. In this chapter we see K, using some his many gadgets to solve this chilling case and we even get some forshadowing to an enemy K will face in the coming chapters. Even after is all said and done the chapter ends bitter sweet for everyone in the story, Ishinmori showing that even when the case is closed, things don't go back magically to what they were before. Some may think that just because this is a series about a robot who solves crimes that it would be cheesy and just silly. Really its more then that, it plays out like a real detecitve story just with a robot as a main character. Ishinmoris hero's come off as silly and over the top but beyond the seemly silly concepts they are characters that are endearing showen by how people still read them to this day and what makes Ishinmori one of historys best. Also I love how even with all the future stuff in the series like K and his flying car the world still acts like it should.

Here's stage 09b.

Bring, what was that "Map event" with the Zeon soldiers? I translated it from the textures, but I didn't come across it while playing. Is it on a second playthrough?

OK, I did a few more tests, I can make other dialogue files without a problem, but it chokes up on this one.

I guess people are going to notice when they open the link, but there's translation files for more than 3 stages in the mediafire link.

Also, I've noticed the file with the translated battle dialogues (v2) is not in the mediafire folder, can you upload it Bring? Get it from here:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/yil6z1bwy3e5zhp/Battle%20Dialogues%20v2.7z

and also the untranslated version (+ txt files):

In case you didn't notice, this game is getting translated. Not only it's being translated, it's being "soft-subbed" using Dolphin (Gamecube/Wii emulator) and you can check the progress of the translation as we release chapters!

Wanna try it? Do the following:

1. Download Dolphin 3.0 from this page. It's the last entry. Note, other versions will not work. Do not get 3.5
http://www.dolphin-emulator.com/download.html

2. Download the stage dialogues (1-2b are in a batch, nothing else has been included in a batch yet) and menu translation from here.
https://www.mediafire.com/srwgc#8hoepp2pmlr88

3. Put the translated textures in User\Load\Textures\GRWJD9\ inside of the Dolphin folder.

4. Set Texture caching to safe.

5. Turn on load custom textures.

6. Enjoy. Tell us about any problems that you find, be sure to include a save state or detailed instructions on how to recreate the problem.

*NOTE: The translation does NOT work in a real Gamecube.
*NOTE 2: There are some joke translations like pic related and MSG:A the actual translation is genuine.

Well I don't think including 10b in this batch is absolutely necessary, it could just go in the next one. The most important think is to not skip any stages. But of course we can include it if we get it done in time.

Also, here's a little batch of stages 1 to 9 (just the text files, though): mediafire.com/?9qomwxqhdno21jf
Use these if you're gonna QC, they already have some fixes compared to the versions I uploaded before.

Okay, uh. This is a little embarrassing, but I did stage 10 without realizing there was a stage 09b. I'm gonna do that next. It's a lot shorter, so I can almost certainly get it done tomorrow, so I guess we hold off on that batch until then? We also could use a new thread, as this one isn't bumping anymore, but I'd like to be able to open the new thread with the batch available.

Anyway here's 10: mediafire.com/?2g9qojk4k42b1st

I reupped my mf folder of it to http://www.mediafire.com/?ii99538j5b884 . There's the streams on Marvel's site (which does let some corporate thing know that you actually like Supaidaaman if you care about that sort of thing). There's also this torrent http://bakabt.me/166284-spider-man-supaid-man.html that is definitely different files than what Marvel offers. Subs look the same. I assume it's a better rip of the R2s with the Marvel subs applied, but I haven't checked it out.

Hahaha no. My moon isn't good enough for translation stuff, just for synopsis. I know the trial has been translated, and there was a Russian group that at least tried to translate it, but I don't know anything more about that.

Also, MediaFire has changed some things, and all accounts seem to have 10gb of space, and it can be expanded with stuff like inviting friends and linking to Facebook.

Here's stage 6. Glad to get this one out today.

Bring, you missed a little dialogue that happens when the Practices attack Dragonar. I suppose this kind of stuff happening once in a while can't be helped though, there's no way we can predict who gets a special dialogue with whom in every single stage. Oh well.
Anyway I dumped the textures for this one myself, so it should be fine.

Well, I'm not a good translator, but I was trying the texture organizer for battle dialogues and the battle editor and came up with some translations for battles in stage 3:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/aykbvkfuymo7eeh/Translated%20Battle%20Dialogues%2001.rar

This translates most lines of Zeon/Giganos soldiers, a bunch of lines of the Dragonar boys, lots Amuro's lines, almost anything that Gene says and a couple of things from Denim, Akimi, Fairey and the J9. Unzip it in the load folder and you'll have some non-accurate translations with a couple of display errors here and there for those guys.

The untranslated textures and the battle dialogue files are here:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/3qlir1c2t8f5vz9/Battle%20Dialogues%20Stage%203%20%28untranslated%29.rar

for whenever a translator can pick them up and correct what I did.

Also, I dumped some of those messages that happen when you save and suspend the game:

https://www.dropbox.com/s/uva98884vnev4vh/Suspend%20Game.rar

Bring, could you add these files to the mediafire folder? That way we won't have a bunch of links later.

This one is a really short doujin, same author as above. Set in beginning of ZZ when Camille is still vegetable state. Poor Fa called Judau for help because Camille was wanking it and it turns kinda heated when he offers to help clean up instead.

I'm not a big fan of veggiestate porn, but it's actually really hot, watching Judau's barriers slowly crumble too. I'm pretty bad, saying that sorry.

This one takes place after ZZ and is pre-curser to CCA. Judau and Camille are shacking up together, Camille is slowly rebuilding his life. While they have sex, Camille is actually thinking about both Amuro and Quattro-- something about being approached by Amuro for recruitment..

Next I'm looking at either ripping my Gold Lightan hks or playing around with the Daimos dub to see if there's any real work involved with synching it to whatever R2 sourced set I have laying around. Because I tried that with Kabuto and it was hard so fuck that.

I changed the spelling of Luna II and Dren to match what's on the Gundam wiki. Also changed it in the previous stage's files, once we have a bit more done I can upload a batch or something.

Also, the dialogue files were all broken, but I guess that's because you guys were working out bugs on the tool. I just remade them with the old version I had.

I'm guessing it's the "Yay" lines. Those were bound to be repeated. They will probably appear some more times. Maybe we should allow duplicates just in case somebody decides to play using only the translation of their current chapter?

Stage 05 all ripped. Like I mentioned earlier, there's a case of a repeated line. The Braiger team has a catchphrase that you already translated, so I didn't bother ripping that line. Also, because this is a repeated line, there was a case where the same line shows up in folder 4 and folder 9. I removed the repeat, because by the time you get to it, you will have already translated it the first time.

SUPER ROBOT TAISEN GC TRANSLATION THREAD #3
Dashman Sun Mar 24 2013 21:55:22 No.8907916 ViewReport	
In case you didn't notice, this game is getting translated. Not only it's being translated, it's being "soft-subbed" using Dolphin (Gamecube/Wii emulator) and you can check the progress of the translation as we release chapters!

Wanna try it? Do the following:

1. Download Dolphin 3.0 from this page. It's the last entry. Note, other versions will not work. Do not get 3.5
http://www.dolphin-emulator.com/download.html

2. Download the stage dialogues (1-2b are in a batch, 3 hasn't been included in a batch yet) and menu translation from here.
https://www.mediafire.com/srwgc#8hoepp2pmlr88
http://www.mediafire.com/?l2h1h5m0hlgem9a - Stage 3

3. Put the translated textures in User\Load\Textures\GRWJD9\ inside of the Dolphin folder.

4. Set Texture caching to safe.

5. Set External Frame Buffer to Virtual (Not sure if necessary)

6. Turn on load custom textures.

7. Enjoy. Tell us about any problems that you find, be sure to include a save state or detailed instructions on how to recreate the problem.

*NOTE: The translation does NOT work in a real Gamecube.

Here's stage 3. This one was kinda long.
I'm really not sure about the romanization of the names of the Dragonar characters, I went with whatever is on Wikipedia.

Also, Bring, there was a little problem on the turn 2 scene, you merged two lines together on line 28. No big deal though, I just dumped the two missing textures myself, but do test it out to make sure I did it right.

I'm not at all confident that I got all the battle intro and outros (these are event dialogues, not battle dialogues). I'll try to find some more after Oppai translates these, that way I can search for Japanese text instead of comparing against stuff that I already have ripped.

This won't work on actual hardware. You need something with a custom texture loading. (or you could play it on your [you mean wii, right?] and open up Oppai's translated dialogue files, since this is a line by line translation.

>Ah, well, that's how Dolphin works, the redump can't be helped... I thought at the beginning that I could use some kind of log with the filenames that had been "moved" already (showing it on the lists somehow) and saving it to a file, but that would become huge after some time. Even if I used a Dictionary class for fast checking the names while in the applet, wouldn't the initial read of the log take a long time when the dumped files start to reach 5 - 6 digits?

Don't worry about it. Except for this time, I always turn off dump textures before going back to rewatch the scene. It's just that I forgot this time. It will indubitably happen again, but I figure it'll be a rare event. Don't worry about fixing this particular case of user error.

These are the complete translated dialogue textures for stages 01, 02 and 02b. It has some of the corrections people suggested so far, though I didn't exactly go through the whole thing again. It's also now sorted in sobfulders by stage.

Just put the "Dialogues" folder inside Dolphin's User\Load\Textures\GRWJD9 folder, with the Dolphin version and settings as explained by Bring in >>8902015, and choose the female protagonist and real robot. Also get the menu textures made by Steve here >>8902169, and you'll be able to play the first three stages almost completely in English. One big thing that's still missing is the scrolling intro, I've included the translation for it in a .txt file, but the textures still need to be done by hand.
Dashman Sat Mar 23 2013 10:41:17 No.8902406 ViewReport	
>>8902347
ah, I just checked Magenta's guide and it seems there are indeed no split routes. The only thing affecting dialogues would be your choice between Super and Real as well as Male and Female. Since you started playing because of this translation, I assume you took the girl and the real robot, right?

Anyway, when I say "upload your save" I just mean your memory card file. It should be in User/GC most probably named as MemoryCardA.JAP.raw.

If you only have one saved game inside the memory card, it would be very helpful if you could start saving one file per stage from now on. When you fill the memory card of saved games, you upload it somewhere (like mediafire) so that somebody can use it to access those stages.

On a different note. I just fixed the bug with getting weird relatives in event dialogues. I check for the alpha of the pixels now, instead of checking if the pixel has a value different than 0. I'll try improving the load of the dump folder now.

This is the first release of the translated menu textures I've been working on. I wanted to finish up some more stuff before doing the first release, but I can always update it as I go.

Take the SRTGC Texture folder, place it in Dolphin's User\Load\Textures\GRWJD9 directory, and...you're done, basically.

>>8902015 has listed the settings you'll need. I don't see any reason this thing wouldn't work, but I'd like some confirmation that it does. I didn't have a chance to change everything over to the Safe-compatible textures, so I'm still working on that.

This is still a work in progress, and nowhere near being complete, but hopefully this will help people play it.

Make sure you have Dolphin 3.0 (no rev). This will NOT work with any other version. Make sure you use D3D9, not 11, not GL, not software, 9. Under Graphics>Hacks, turn texture caching to safe (very left of the slider) and enable virtual external frame buffer. After that, set internal resolution, fullscreen resolution, anti-aliasing, and anisotropic filter to whatever settings your computer can handle. Lastly turn on load custom textures.

Set up the controller however you'd like.

Then, download the three texture packs that Oppai has released so far.
http://www.mediafire.com/srwgc#8hoepp2pmlr88

Put them in DolphinFolder\User\Load\Textures\GRWJD9\

I got another funny for you. I left "Dump Textures" on while I was going though the outro the second time so I can match the dumped text to the dialogue (I don't really need it, but I feel safer that way. What was basically happening, was that I used your tool to move the files over to my sorted folder, and as soon as Dolphin saw that that texture wasn't dumped, it redumped it. Since the textures are sorted by dump date, I didn't even notice that this was going on until I finished the outro, reached the intermission menu, and saw that I still had the same fuckhuge list of unsorted (white) textures as when I started.

And speaking of the end of Stage 03.
http://www.mediafire.com/?15c79pkg9z8fk0h

Furthermore, what should I choose as as the FUB for Soul Gunner? It already has an S in air and space, so that isn't too useful, and none of the other options seem like they provide much of an improvement. Movement seems to be the least bad option.

You know what, I'll just repost my stuff, the other thread is dead and past bump limit.
I put together a compilation of the original versions of the game's BGMs. I heartily recommend it, there's some really good stuff in there. A few things to say, though :
-I never managed to find Miku's songs, so the songs are the originals from Virtual On, and Believe is just the game version because it might actually be original to the game. Sorry.
-The numbering is wacky, because I was trying to match it to the actual game OST, and it has things like the Final Mission two-parter that mess it up.
-I put in the vocal version of Deus Machina as a bonus because I really like that song.

So here it is, if someone wants some good music.

Some dude, I guess called Squall, did subs through episode 36. I don't know if he ripped them off of something like CR or if this is an old translation from somewhere else but I don't think they are the same translation as Live-Evil's episodes. I haven't compared them against the video or checked if they are well timed or not so that would probably be a good idea for anyone to do.

Some guys I never heard of called R-Z productions did 37-60, but 37-48 are all 2 episode per script which, though it should be easy enough to split the script and time shift the second half to where it should be, almost always means that the script gets progressively more out-of-sync as the video goes on because they (I don't know why but this is my theory) are probably ripped off or timed to a DVD or something and lacking a time ramp but fuck if I know since I am limited in such knowledge. After 48 the files through 60 are just .txt transcripts from RZ and should probably just be ignored.

Here it is, all non-battle dialogue in stage 1 translated. Just throw the textures into the proper folder or use the text files to generate them with the tool (I guess I could upload just the text files, but whatever). With everything at the usual settings, it should work. I also added a few more place names to the txt with the rest of the stuff that needs to be edited by hand.

I'm not very familiar with Trider or Raijin-Oh so I might have messed something up there (particularly the Raijin-Oh villains, I really don't know what they're talking about most of the time). Any problems can be fixed later though, it's no big deal thanks to the tool. Some of the shady people and Sieg's dialogue might need revision too once I know more about the Original plot in this game, but we'll see when we get there.

I last released up to the mission objectives. Did you see dash's v1.2 tool? It automatically grabs filenames from a folder.

This has all the in-mission event dialogue (except for once you kill all enemies).
http://www.mediafire.com/?uyt7xhu4sxc5psc

Dash. Tool idea. Battle dialogue. Low priority.
Folder structure:

Dialogue name
| -- 1
| .. + -- file
| -- 2
| .. + -- file
| -- 3
| .. + -- file
etc.

Battle dialogue with special character for breaks.
eg. Raijin-Oh! -> Ra^i^ji^n-^O^h^!

Will generate 8 textures:
<blank except for pilot name>
Ra
Rai
Raiji
Raijin-
Raijin-O
Raijin-Oh
Raijin-Oh!

Like I said, low priority, event dialogue is more important.

Alright people, I have some good news, tempered with some shitty news. Battle dialogue can be texture edited. Even better, Dashman's tool can be used to edit it.

Bad News: It will be a pain, a massive pain. Even worse, avoiding duplicates is also going to be a pain. I was hoping that Dolphin had subfolder dump support (include already dumped files in a folder and it won't redump them), but it doesn't.

Proof

Dash could you update your tool to look for where the names are on the battle dialogue? The auto label didn't work on these for some reason. Here's a package with an enemy and ally dialogue.

Here it is, translations of everything from >>8884518. That's the shady people conversation, the big scrolling intro, the flashback scene and the first scene at the office. Just dump all the textures in the User\Load\Textures\GRWJD9 folder and it should work, though make sure you're using Dolphin 3.0 with texture cache accuracy at SAFE. Choose female protagonist, real robot (not sure this matters though) and leave all names at default.

I didn't do the textures for the scrolling intro though, since that would have taken too long on top of doing the translation, but I did include a .txt with the translation for it and another few textures that need to be done by hand. It would be real nice if someone volunteers to do those.

Also I suppose I'll identify myself in my posts from now on so things don't get too confusing.

Anyone and everyone. Here's my "translation" of the hangar scene before mission 1. Use the female MC with real robot and default name.

>>8884663
Oh, translator anon, you can reuse the script that I posted above to make the hangar translation go faster for you, since you won't have to put in the correct numbers.

Another general announcement. Like >>8878607 said, people can take my dump and run it through the tool, saving empty scripts so translator anon can do the translation even faster.

The dump now has everything up to, but not including, the episode 1 title card ripped and sorted. Same settings as >>8884518
The folder names use Milky instead of Akimi. The only reason for that is that I reused my old folders and kept the new ones as Milky for consistency. This /was/ captured with the default name.

http://www.mediafire.com/?d3qod3ibxqdqa60

>>8884663
For everything that you cant use the tool for (scrolling text, messages, location cards, title cards once I get to them) just include a txt in the same folder with the translation. Your time is too valuable to waste with photoshopping. Photoshoppers are common, translators are rare.

Right, well I'm going to assume you'll want to translate from English to some language that wasn't one of the six included. If so, here are the raw English subs. They're in VobSub (IDX/SUB) format. Hopefully you know how to handle these. Enjoy.

In case I die or for anyone's peace of mind. There are probably some other refinements that could be done but I am waiting for the actual BD rips to sync the OP/ED lyrics to the hardsubbed kana and do the styles. I plan on doing that and the time-shifting myself.

I made some changes to the grammar where I just couldn't ignore it but I tried to avoid it as much as possible since that wasn't my goal. I also may have missed some stuff in my sleepless nights or you may not agree to various other things in punctuation/capitalization. If anyone wants to spruce it up in that regard or do some TL checks I will give you a free blowjob. There were places I found the translation questionable but I don't know Japanese, I think the only time I changed a line based on that was when Deck said "atarimae desho" and the sub said something like "The enemy's in front!" which I think is too wrong to be translation error and most likely some kind of misplaced line or something.

When I say "near-perfect" copies of the times, some lines are delayed from the Shin-Getter sub by a few hundredths of a second but I do not think it should matter since they had lead-in anyway. If you are just some kind of obsessive time freak Shin-Getter purist and care about it so much you will go through it again, I will give you a free blowjob as well.

But I doubt anyone will be getting a free blowjob.

M.D. Geist - 2013 Edit DDL
Vendaval Este Fri Mar 08 2013 17:30:25 No.8850661 ViewReport	
Quoted By: >>8850823
I recently came out with this:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoEGiHA3m94

A "fix" of the original cut of M.D. Geist that uses DVD and Laserdisc footage of both the 1986 and 1996 versions to make a complete version free of nearly all of the initial animation errors, re-purposed 1996 animation, some new audio to make some reworked scenes transition better along with some printed source material being referenced to expand the prologue slightly. I did this because the original voice cast version seems to be the most well-liked and considering it's never been properly "restored" I felt I may as well have done it while making use of the other material that was inadvertently spawned through M.D. Geist being released in the US.

What I now have is a DDL .avi with a soft sub file for those who may have wanted this thing on their computer, this download's subs have also been timed a little better, re-written slightly and as well as that some other things have been tidied up so the presentation is now much cleaner and neater. This should hopefully be a considered option for people looking to watch this OVA for the first time as well.

Of course, the new image resources stash is somewhat up already, so you can nab sprites and other stuff from there. I'm currently uploading Win7 MLA sprite set there. It's still vastly unsorted thou.

Re-uploading to MediaFire is ultimately a passive task, you just drop files there and wait them to upload. Sadpanda requires you to select every file individually you want to upload, which would mean actually me sitting here and actively clicking though 9 610 files for Muv-Luv Extra/Unlimited alone. Still, if they have streamlined the upload process, then I might consider it.

Just for Trivia, Win7 MLA has 26 220 separate CG images.

The MF that had complete rips has been deleted due to MediaFire's policy. Funny thing that it was the Yukikaze artbooks I had there that caused the deletion.

I'll be re-uploading all the pictorial materials starting from next week, or this week depending how much work/ fever I have. So OP, if you want to have ML/A CG sets uploaded first, just say the word. Gabby has the right to veto this.

Some anon, back when the official release came out, posted an EXE file that fixed that I think. I know I can play it and I'm running Windows 7. I'll see if I can find it and up it to Mediafire or some site.

I haven't downloaded a torrent since 2009. I just never got around to it. And I haven't used mIRC since 2007. I was so used to DDL hosting sites like Rapid, Mega, Mediafire, etc.

Is there a guide to DL'ing torrents the smart way and not being tracked? I never get anything that's from the US. Usually pre-2000's anime that isn't licensed, manga, and some Japanese live action shows.

Hey op, here's what I can help you with:
These are the past scrubs from episode 17 to 33:

http://www.mediafire.com/555scrubs

These were all the episodes done by JettoSubs, they also did the movie DC version but the subs were lost (if somebody has it please re-upload!)

you can also find this helpful:

http://japasubs.com/serie.php?c=rider&s=kr_555

That site has english subs (looks like tvn rips) for eps 7 - 14 and the movie. You will also find the portuguese subs' timing useful if you use it as a template for your works.

As stated before, TVN has fixed most of the translation mistakes up to episode 28 for their v2 releases. The problem really starts with everything after that.

I think it would be useful to have someplace more permanent than a regular thread to store these collective uploads. Do you think it would be possible to make a page on Akurasu with mediafire links? Would that site's owner allow it? It's one of the places I know of that a lot of english-speaking SRW fans visit.

Hey op, here's what I can help you with:
These are the past scrubs from episode 17 to 33:

http://www.mediafire.com/555scrubs

These were all the episodes done by JettoSubs, they also did the movie DC version but the subs were lost (if somebody has it please re-upload!)

you can also find this helpful:

http://japasubs.com/serie.php?c=rider&s=kr_555

That site has english subs (looks like tvn rips) for eps 7 - 14 and the movie. You will also find the portuguese subs' timing useful if you use it as a template for your works.

As stated before, TVN has fixed most of the translation mistakes up to episode 28 for their v2 releases. The problem really starts with everything after that.

I recently remembered that I and a couple other anons uploaded Kamen Rider Agito to Mediafire and KRDL simply refuses to add them to the site for some reason so people haven't been able to readily get the show lately.

I think it would be useful to have someplace more permanent than a regular thread to store these collective uploads. Do you think it would be possible to make a page on Akurasu with mediafire links? Would that site's owner allow it? It's one of the places I know of that a lot of english-speaking SRW fans visit.

Okay, I'm in a predicament here, /m/.

I haven't watched Go-Busters or Wizard since December or so since I've been busy (and lazy), but I've still managed to download all of the raws regardless. Since Go-Busters finally ended this week, I figured that I'd take some time out of my schedule to finally finish it, but the patches are no longer available since the MediaFire links are all dead (same with the scripts). The Wizard patches and scripts are still there though.

Basically, I need the patches for Go-Busters from 44 to 48 (I got lazy about downloading raw 49, and they released the subbed version inbetween). I dunno if O-T can re-upload them (if they see this message), or if anyone can provide an upload for me, because I don't want to have to download the entire subbed versions when I already have the raws.

The great men of Happy Scans just released the Giant Robo manga.

Some of you may remember the epic, stellar Giant Robo OVA series, directed by the great Yasuhiro Imagawa. Truly a masterpiece. Here, however, we present you the original manga it was based on, another Sci Fi classic by our man, Mitsuteru Yokoyama. A more...uplifting story than Mars, to be certain. Featuring the heroes controlling Giant Robo against the world-domination plotting group Big Fire.

Thanks to our friends at Dynamic Pro for scanning this beast and Chaos for his epic translation work. And a big thanks to our man Ani_ for his great typesetting, and Kazu for his QC job. Hope to have volume 2 out before long!

Alright /m/, it's late here and I'm tired, so I'll make this short. I finished the translation to Anaheim Girl's Love Story, that Gundam yuri Visual Novel, and this is the release thread. If you've ever wanted to see a bunch of lesbians building a Gundam, well, here's your chance. Download here: mediafire.com/?1yyki7exzlcmshx (that's just the translation, find the game for yourself.)

As I've said before, this is NOT a patch, it's an external translation to be read alongside the real thing. I think I managed to make it fairly simple to use, it works like you see in the picture, but do read the included instructions. Also, I double-checked the whole thing to the best of my ability and sanity, but it's entirely possible that I fucked something up, so report any problems and I'll fix them as soon as I can. It's a small download, so I can always replace whatever.

As I said Action Stations is actually pretty damn good, though it takes a bit more of a 'Star Wars' approach to WC (there are a bunch of aliens species that either weren't in the game or were briefly mentioned just living around the galaxy and even on earth, there's a obligatory hive of scum and villainy, etc)
It's really about Tolwyn's early days as a cadet and is treated as a historical drama that tried to illuminate on why he ended up space-Hitler.
Also it shows Kilrathi who even OPPOSE the fucking war.

Here's all the novels:

The chineerune one? sorry about that, I still need to start a new mediafire now that I've learned a few tricks about dodging their new hassles.

I can storytime it over today and tomorrow at least, maybe I can re-up it, but I'm gonna be busy on and off.

Long time no see /m/, after a few months of absence I've finally subbed episode 5.
You can find the episode here: http://pastebin.com/aAdrvX5T

I'm not going to risk posting mediafire links on /m/ since it got me banned for a week last time.

As with the past episodes, I am sure there are lines I've goofed up on, please point them out if you can.
There were also some parts I just couldn't decipher even after listening to them over and over again.

As for the story, the introduction arc finally comes to an end and we slide into the guerilla warfare arc next.

So the game itself looks pretty much exactly like what players at Battletech Centers experienced for five or six bucks a pop back in the early 90's.

Could it have helped save the Sega CD though?

alternate retelling of the original series, no zeta nor ZZ. it's just called a trilogy because it was released as three books, the first called "awakening", the second called "escalation", the third called "confrontation"

it's not canon in any way, but it provides a bit of insight into some of the characters, at least the ones that didn't change much in depiction

it's quite a departure from the original series, amuro and crew are enlisted soldiers training to pilot the project V MS rather than "teenagers forced to pilot gundams", the entire story is set in space and does not go to earth, and other things happen, like the RX-78-2 being destroyed and amuro receiving the G3 as a replacement

the ending is quite different as well, it involves amuro being killed by a grunt pilot after he lets his guard down, and the white base teaming up with kycilia's newtype unit to go after and kill ghiren

here's the link to the same scans I have. I think someone on /m/ was converting this into an ebook format, but I don't know where to get it, or whether /rs/ lists it

There's Sentinel, a book about a kid doing the Iron Giant routine with a mutant-killing machine. Pretty good read.
Here are scans, because you'll probably never find the books : http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?da44mvwbfec3m4h

Also, I remember one JLA : Cold Steel, where the Justice League ends up piloting mech versions of themselves on an alien planet. Don't have links to that one, though.

So /m/ have you guys seen the preview for this yet? Thoughts?

http://www.mediafire.com/?jgmmuob4t11o3cw
http://www.sendspace.com/file/1zbjkd
http://www.tusfiles.net/0g8zzi24v3yy
http://ryushare.com/geypq02spjwv/Cyborg_009_-_Chapter_000_(2013)_(93pgs-Digital-Nero).cbz

As far as art goes I've always been a fan of Marcus To, but seeing Cyborg 009 with American cape like art is a bit weird. I'd probably have preferred someone more cartoony, but if I have to accept it with cape art, Marcus To probably would have been a first choice anyway.

As far as designs go, in terms of looking at them as an American cape version of Cyborg 009 I do actually love them and I'm glad the scarfs will be coming into it at some point. Because of To's style the characters are pretty sleek and at most look toned, or well built for some, while none are bursting out of their clothes barely able to contain their muscles. Plus there was a clear effort to maintain a lot of the exaggerated facial featuers some characters had while doing it in a more realisitic style that I appreciate.

I know we'd seen some of these preview pages that showed the powers in action already, but I do actually like the visual depiction of the powers. I feel like the Iron Man style legs for 002 is a good way to approach his ability to fly being a cyborg.

In terms of actual story I'll need to see when it actually comes out in full but from the preview it feels too close to the original. Don't get me wrong if it wasn't holding true to the original I'd be pretty annoyed by it, but it feels so close I question the point of it. It lacks any real individuallity and so many moments feel like reading the original manga but just with Marcus To art. But we'll see when the full thing hits I guess.

Quoted By: >>8696552
I found this thread yesterday and became pretty interested. After reading docs I tried to hack 2G. First I modified character set a little, because game didn't have small letters (had to make them myself, so you can imagine how awful they are). Then I experimented with HEX editor, and now I have full table for my edited ROM, including punctuation marks and hiragana/katakana that wasn't used for making small letters. I could also translate the game, but I'm lazy fucktard and I seriously doubt I can ever complete it. Besides, as you can see, my English almost reaches crabstick level, so there's probably no need for such "translation".

The Penultimate chapter...

That feel when the villain you thought was an Edo period knockoff of Skull from Cyborg 009 turns out to be a total badass… This chapter made the entire series for me.

Chapter 1 of Gun Driver, in English. Full credit goes to justpassingby for translating. A long time ago.

The script was pretty rough, as the only reason it was really translated was because I asked him to give me basic details of the story.

This was extremely good. The only problem I had was that it was difficult at times to keep track of what was going on, but I chalked that up to the fact that you had to draw 68 pages in under 7 days.

I'd like to see you expand on this. It was a fun read and I'd like to see a proper version done where you didn't have a silly little deadline forcing you to rush through the pages.

That also happened to me before. I think Mediafire checks if the file you're trying to upload is already in their servers uploaded by someone else, and if it is they just create a new link to it. Or something like that.

Crossposted from /tg/.

Gentlemen.
After a great amount of rewrites and starting back from scratch because I'm never happy with anything I do EVER, I'd like to present /tg/ (and /m/) with the first alpha of a game I've been working on, Super Robot Wars OG Tabletop.

Just as the name says, it's meant to be a RPG set in the Super Robot Wars OG universe, with the characters as robot pilots. For now, all that's done is the core mechanics, character creation, and little more.

The game hasn't been playtested extensively, and is probably broken as hell. It doesn't have a contents index, and I'm aware that it's likely badly organized.

But I wanted to share this, hoping for some feedback. If you can spare the time to flip through this and contribute with criticism, ideas, suggestions or anything useful, I'd be thankful.

(I don't normally tripfag, but I'm taking up a tripcode for the purpose of this thread.)

I have a question, though. With the Russian theme for Holmgrad, is there any particular reason we're calling them a Grand Duchy and it's leader a Duke/Duchess and not Tsardom lead by a Tsar/Tsarina? That kinda harkens back to the pre-Russian Empire when Rus Principalities like Novgorod, Moscowy, Kiev and many other Russian kingdoms/countries existed. Not that it really bothers me, but I'm curious.

The translations are pretty poor but are readable enough. Gunshinkyoushuu is a sequel to Kishin Taido. I recommend doing the other routes in Demonbane before reading them though.

Someone on /m/ tonight claimed the Daimos Filipino dub was lost, also mentioned that Dorkly no longer had them on his mediafire; I happen to have them, so I made a torrent for ya. Only thing is, I have no idea how to get this thing hosted on something like TPB or bakabt; uploaded it to 2shared at least.

I'll seed this for the next fifteen hours or so, but I normally just keep torrents running during the night so I'm not sure how well this is gonna work to be honest. If someone has an alternative method to spending six hours individually uploading each video to a site though, I'm all ears.

Also be warned, these are not good quality videos; they're 55mb .wmv files, and sound like you'd expect from someone recording them with a VCR twenty-thirty years ago. They are, however, the only English dub of Daimos I know to exist, even if it is hilariously bad.

It's almost 2013, nobody is reuploading shit on Mediafire these days. Secondly, there are no DLs for it. If you want DLs of it, go right-click and save every fucking image yourself.

Just put on adblock and read it online. Jesus.

That being said, Crossbone > Skull Heart > Steel 7. I wasn't crazy about Steel 7 at all, really. Ghost is okay, but why did he turn into a black blind man? Because he was too close to the laser when it exploded?

If I remember correctly, original translator just put translation into a doc file and said that anyone can edit them into scans.
Here you go. Volume 3 and translation in a doc file are in this archive. Actually, I started working on it once, but never got far. So in this archive I also added pages that I already edited, so you can start from there.

"Based Newtype"? Wha?

My mediafire account was shut down so all of the DDLs and what not were removed. You can view a majority of the manga by clicking on the "GALLERY" link at the top. I still have to setup more DDL links for the older series and what not.

We're not touching Steel 7 because from what I understand someone else handled that, despite fan misgivings about it. I have Crossbone Ghost Volume 2 complete, but I have to fart around with some missing pages from the volume and what not. That series is going to hell rather quickly it seems...

I got you guys the gokaiger doujin as soon as I received it last year. It can be downloaded there:

For this one it's gonna be the same deal, no scans but photos except for the cover, which is the only bit I can scan without damaging it.

Completely related but not them together. The usual Nakayama pattern is villains-on-girl action and some extra mecha sketches. So it'll probably be Enter doing it.

There was few nice nudges towards the ML/A as well. I do wish BETA had been slightly more pressing, especially whenever they were on the screen and and the background around the characters could've used more ambient detail on how the overall world situation had effected the people, like in that one episode where the streets are rather empty.
Now that you mention it, the cast in TE is rather international, even thou they follow anime tropes. Then again, some characters got barely any growth, like Macaroni.

What were your expecations for the series when you started watching it?

I would link you to the VN downloads I have, if there wouldn't have been a purge from MediaFire's side. Not that it's hard to good downloads for the main stories, but if you're interested in other resources, I'm sure the link provided in the e-mail field should keep you busy for a while.

And yes, the whole franchise as gone through a big explosion that keeps spreading. I've been in a bit over a year, and it feels that it's been growing enormously during that time, and I can only imagine how much it has grown since -06

I know that in the past several months we have not exactly been on the best of terms, but that was entirely because some god damn OOZtard (see HyperKivat) thought that by tripfagging as me he could get away with posting shit like links to subs from groups or whatever other shit I see he did in the Foolz.us archive (also he stalked some tripfag on /toy/ which confused me).

Anyway, I figure it's best to shut up and make up for all the shit that flip put you through by sharing with you music that has no been posted anywhere else on the Interwebs because I purchased the single myself because I can totally do that now that I'm on the moon.

So here's the Wizard & Fourze Movie War Ultimatum theme song "FOREST OF ROCKS" by Seikima-II's Demon Kakka.

Re-up them to mediafire
Scramble the names and post some kind of key here or make it an easy one like (Edgar Los Oranges Tells the Time = ELO - Time) or something.

That is unless they've IP blocked you, then I recommend Deposit files or Packupload or whatever H-S is using.

No, actually I didn't self post that. Secondly, I'm not 'giving' myself any money whatsoever because I don't need to? I'm hosting the content directly and instead of having a direct URL to the file on my server, I installed a wordpress plugin that prevents that. Lord knows my host would throw a shitfit. My mediafire accounts keep getting pulled. Ergo: fail.

Sigh. 'Kay, my bad, I'm not in the happiest of moods, I apologize and no excuse for my behavior.

I follow the instructions up to where I run SDGOFOCU.bat and continue on, but even with all the files in the right places (according to OmegaSwordEX and the ReadMe.txt), I continue to get an error saying that the patch/files it's looking for aren't in the right places. Inside the main SDGO folder, in Custom, and nothing happens, and I've used both SDGOFOCU.bat and sdgundamext.exe, and the former just gives me said problem and the latter doesn't even stay open longer than a tenth of a second.

Omega says use "sdgcfoext" but there's no file like that in the mediafire link that was in the pastebin in the OP.

Is that a bit clearer now?

Figured I might as well repost this here: http://www.mediafire.com/?lb8catctlrqriem

It's an early draft of the script, and it mentions some robots we haven't seen yet (including more US ones and a couple of South American ones) and also gives us some more ideas about their capabilities. One very high tech robot, a newer model, round-house kicks a kaiju, though it almost blows out the shock absorbers in its legs in the process.

Gipsy Danger, the older, slightly out of date American model, has a plasma cannon, a chest laser, a shoulder-mounted Gatling cannon, a retractable magnetic chain that can stiffen into a sword, and hip-mounted missile launchers.

I asked this in /anime/ and in /a/, but in case those doesn't get any replies,

Can I run something by anyone who cares to listen?

As you can see above, I was trying to insert the existing translation of the TE demo into the game using NullPointer's plugin (the one currently used for the Before the Shimmering Time Ends translation).

However as mentioned above on close inspection there appears to have been some pretty liberal rewriting and embellishing, so I tried to reword it to be a bit closer to the original.

But my Japanese ability is definitely almost nonexistent (one only has to look at the timeline on the wiki to know that), and it's very slow going as it's almost a complete retranslation, and a poor one too.

So,
Here's what I've done so far
http://www.mediafire.com/view/?hrn7b5dcwn9rfvt

And here's his translation
http://www.mediafire.com/view/?k21q55zbbblyqwy

Is anyone able and willing to check it over and judge whether or not that guy's translation is good enough to just be stuck straight in, and if not whether someone else is willing to pick this up? Because I don't think I'll be able to do this anymore with deadlines and midsessional exams approaching, and with my level of 'Japanese' the timeline translation was already taxing enough (I'm sure anyone who was around at the time could see how much I had to come here and beg for help), and that was just a timeline with really simple and straigthforward sentences.

hey OP, did you implement pilot stats and etc? Because generally pilots have some significance to the story, and in RPGs in general is also like that. Also, an anon translated the ATX mangas, it would REALLY help you, because almost everything that wasn't illustrated before (like the chobbam armor for example) is shown there equipped in the Mech.

Mediafire took down the raw, the only raw torrents available are unseeded. Should be re-uploaded, but renamed something else so Mediafucker won't be suspicious.

Gather, my children, for I come to you bearing a gift.

It saddens me to see you all wallowing, eating scraps from those ridiculous Japanese fellows. So, I decided to introduce all of you to Roboanimation (Robanime), an exclusive form of Arabic animation, totally created by the Middle East and not imported from anywhere else.

My first show will be compelling masterpiece, Lightningbolt. A show that is often confused for the inferior Tetsujin 28. Also, any Japanese you think you might hear or see in the show is totally not Japanese, you're just imagining it.

This is 1980 Tetsujin episode 01, subbed in English, but with Arabic dub as the only audio source.
Audio is kinda terrible in quality, but'll do.

VIDEO: http://www.mediafire.com/?pk1rzdzhsoetbra
SUBS: http://www.mediafire.com/?r3sordgfe0b1nlz

There are two sets of subs. One is just translations, other has a few silly notes from me, pick your poison. There's some credits from the guys who made this rip available, and as far as I can tell I can't really remove it, sorry. It's only for like 10 seconds at the start, though.

Suku Suku Scratch
Anonymous Fri Nov 23 2012 15:57:12 No.8471709 ViewReport	
Time for your weekend homework assignment /m/. You are to scratch build your favorite design.

For reference you are given Mitsuaki Misaki's Suku-Suku Scratch articles series published monthly in Dengeki Hobby from July 2010 to September 2012 detailing his build of the 1/100 Galbaldy Beta. His name should be familiar to at least some because he's the author of the world famous Gundam Scratch Build Manual which itself is a compilation of Suku-Suku Scratch articles from 1999-2003.

The article series goes through the many, many ways and techniques you can use to build what you desire. This is raw Japanese and unlikely to ever be translated but still incredibly useful. If you don't know japanese or anything about plastic models this might be overwhealming and confusing. If you do have at least some basis in model building this should be very insightful.

http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?t8492p0mvhbpvl5

Good luck with your build.

I remember getting the first 5 from a Mediafire folder but there wasn't a 6th one in it.

I seriously hope, that this movie does not IN ANY WAY IMPLY that Kaworu is going to steal Rei Q from Rei II.

>>8464706
>Er, you do realize that that's referring to Lilith right
I didn't. It's not like Rei hasn't been dissolved before, heh

So the hole is in Lilith's abdomen, and the scales are also on Lilith?

So Rei Q doesn't have scales on her groin? Just how much do you see, anything explicit?
It's just the regular, can't-see-sheet kind of deal right?

>??????

There is speculah that says Adam is now Lilith and vice versa. Though it's only because the mask was switched in 2.0.

>Could be either scales or the skin peeling also there's a big hole in her abdomen with the contents spilling out.
....oh no. Entrails, gore? It means she might not be able to keep her own shape.... she might fall apart.

>Yes. She seems to be growing her own personality though, as I've said before.
Damn. I had heard this, and this is actually a problem for me....
I was hoping Rei Q would become Rei II's body, but if she's got herself a personality, they will either have to merge or one will "perish"...
A dilemma is born.... but I'll cheer for Rei II. A merge is fine.

>And then there's possible bit of her picking up the Walkman though that's not shown.
I really, really hope so.

>Can't recall the bit with the AT field.
There was this part where Asuka went "NO AT-FIELDO!?!", and I was thinking it would make sense because if ReiQ has no soul, she couldn't generate an AT-field perhaps.

Below are links to audio rips of the movie:

>Didn't the Eva-13 absorb it along with Lilith or something?
I'm not sure.

Also, is it true that the Mark.09 uses it's scythe to decapitate the Mark.06?

>And then there's possible bit of her picking up the Walkman though that's not shown.
Gah..... this movie is doing things to me I can't really get with any other fiction. I haven't even watched it yet. I hope, I really hope she picks it up...

>>8464698
Yes. She was Yui Ikari, and Gendo took her name. Now she's Yui Ayanami, and took Gendo's name.

There you go, this is the end of Mazinger Angels. Though it seems like it's not the end, but there isn't any more. The final story arc is rushed and ends rather abruptly, I can only imagine it might have been cancelled or something. Still worth a read though, for the fact that it has GATTAIGER, if nothing else.

We all know how the GM rarely gets any kills on screen. But you know what would be great? Making a video with every time a GM gets a kill.

I figure this project would be difficult alone considering all the episodes of Gundam that would need to be watched in order to make something like this possible, so I was wondering if /m/ would work together and find clips of GMs kicking Zeke ass.
Here's my plan

Different Anon here - I'm in the process of uploading both albums to Mediafire. Volume 2 is currently at 19% with an estimated 26 minutes left, and volume 1 hasn't started uploading yet.

So you'll probably get volume 2 first, which is okay because that's the one with Time for L-Gaim.

The archives are little bit under the works after MF decided to delete my uploads, so some stuff haven't been restored yet.

Manga scanner here. Thanks for the reupload!

I ended up losing my progress on the rest of Rintarou when my external HDD died. I actually did reupload the completed volumes on Mediafire, but they got taken down again because Mediafire somehow flagged them as Naruto chapters.

I'd like to get back to completing it but it might be a while yet since I don't have the volumes with me. I'll see about scanning some of the Medarot 2 official art in the meantime though.

I decided to kill the other thread and make a new one, since this is kind of an event. I had to split vol.4 in two parts because of Mediafire's filesize limit. And volumes 1 to 3 are new versions with some re-edited pages, but no changes to the translation or anything, other than some spelling.

Well I hope people enjoy it. That's why I did it anyway.

Some archive "news"
The second stash is now full after uploading Soko ni Umi ga Atte and âge's 13th demo disc. I need to make a third mediafire account at some point most likely.
I'm uploading bunch of demo videos from the mentioned demo disc to the first stash at the moment, thou most of them can be found in Youtube already. There's also bunch of unrelated uploads spanning from Mega Man demos to Yukikaze artbooks. Win7 edition CGs are most likely sorted properly before December if I have the time. Then I'll return sorting the Chronicles CGs.

How do you start a Goushi centric episode? By playing Mei’s character song of course! No, I don’t why they picked that song but at least it’s catchy. This episode made me shed manly tears, girly tears, and had me going “FUCK YEAH!” all at the same time. It’s pretty amazing and manages to be happier than the last two episodes but still pretty sad. This episode is a bit like that Mei episode we had a while back, in the sense that Goushi is the only ranger in this episode, until the very end of course. The character of the day, Sayaka, is really cool and I almost wish she was a recurring guest. Fun note about her actress: She’s sppeared in Turboranger episode 31 and Fiveman episode 34. Also according to this short entry she did a lot of action scenes in these episodes and because she was wearing a skirt there was, obviously, a lot of panty shots. Now apparently she’s rather proud of these shots. Don’t believe me? Here’s Magenta’s summary of the article: “Basically “she had a lot of action scenes and she was in a skirt with bloomers that ended up causing a lot of panty shots because creepy fucking filming techniques, but for some reason this crazy bitch found it kinda amusing and is proud of it”". So yeah… I’ll just leave you with that, and this link to Mei’s character song: Yumemiru Otome no Chikara Kobu

There was a mediafire with all the chapter up until 34, that was posted a few months ago. That's how I got in the series. Don't have the link anymore, but maybe OP can help?

Anyway, just read the final two chapters and holy manly tears. It was so good, I need to find the time to re-read everything some day.

Looking forward to the epilogue too. The big revelation and the preparation for the last battle absolutely crushed me, so I'm totally okay with some light-hearted silliness.

Anyone playing it, patch the game with the 1.01 patch. It fixes framerate issues and freeze glitches.

>Download http://www.mediafire.com/?26qxcveunj98b0f
>Put iso_tool into the PSP/GAME/ folder
>Run ISO Tool
>Pick your Danball Senki W ISO
>Hit X, pick Create Updater
>When it's done go back to the XMB
>Highlight the Game file it made, hit Triangle and hit Update, download the 1.01 patch
>When it's done, open ISO Tool back up
>Select Danball Senki W's ISO again
>Pick "Update" to re-compile the ISO to 1.01
>Delete the game file you used to do the update
>Run the ISO as usual

Framerate gets much smoother and stable, and the freeze issues are solved.

B-5 has an amazing amount of cash up for grab if you capture everything but it's a complete slogfest. CORE 1 is a combination of quick and cash (100k for completion + total capture), plus there are enemy Masters everywhere, making it good for random grinding too.

Oh good, the thread's still here.
This is rather unorthodox for me, but I'm having a double release today. Chapter 15 had slightly fewer pages than usual, and a lot of it were training scenes with no real dialogue, so it went pretty quickly and I decided to push a little further and get 16 out today as well. This way I can finish this story arc tomorrow. Which is good because I won't be able to release on the weekend, and I'd feel bad to leave off at a cliffhanger.

Volume 2 batch: mediafire.com/?70q9rh3for4szz7
Just chapter 13+extras: mediafire.com/?ko6wgzks88i8zjv
I only had to fix like two or three typos for the batch, so there's no real need to get it if you already have the individual chapters.

Also, I've said this before, but I think volume 3 is where the series gets really awesome, so look forward to it.

Technically, but not as much as some people for better or worse. I still miss stuff as it is, if someone was going to do a BD batch at the end with typesetting or something I'd go change some more stuff. Arguably I should learn to do some of that. Case in point the caption at the beginning of ep.1 that said "Imperial Guard Training Academy" and some crazy claptrap of stuff in Commie's version should be "Japanese Imperial Royal Guard Eishi Training Academy" but it would just be massive and awful looking with the basic font.

Nothing big, only translation note is that the UFC in Bao-Feng's logo makes it pretty fucking obvious what the proper English format of the Chinese alliance's name is and Why Do You Capitalize Things For No Reason CrunchyRoll? I considered making the "yare yare" more Kyon-ish but...if you notice it you'll notice it.
http://www.mediafire.com/?c8049drbu64r1

Really I actually would like to have a good standard release when this is all over for archiving, reference, and not having to explain translation fuck ups for the rest of time reasons but I don't even have the ISP to do anything about it even if I were to figure out encoding as well. (and I don't have nor any time soon plan to have a 1080p screen either so god knows I shouldn't be doing that for BDs)

The problem is that Mediafire has a size limit of 200MBs... I suppose I could split it up?
In any case, I'll start on the subs tomorrow morning and figure it out when I'm done. Have a random comparison shot. Note that Shinsen's version looks like smeared shit. Also note the slightly modified shading (and karaoke, for some reason, and that Johnny's been moved slightly to the right, for equally mysterious reasons).

Also Martian fighting machines turn up. Anyway have a link, as was previously said this is like Duwang Guy levels of translation, often yet understandable enough to still have a fun read.

This time we have the 1984 TV anime "Video Senshi Laserion" - the first anime to feature the concept of virtual reality. The main character's mecha literally comes straight out of his game after an accident that occured during an experiment with teleportation.

Continuing from my previous thread, I've finished up volume one. Aside from chapters 1 to 6, there's some extra material with a bunch of technical info and meta-history on the robots. Pretty cool.

Complete volume 1: mediafire.com/?u57wk1327uhxhbo
Just ch.6 + extras: mediafire.com/?ybejorxkvjcldou

All the previous chapters in the volume batch have some fixed typos and better editing and such, so you might want to get that even if you already got the chapters before.

Unsourced hokum the best kind of hokum.

A lots of things in our universe is straight out, pure unadulterated nonsense.

Like, isn't it weird, that our moon covers the sun exactly when it passes in front of it? This would mean, that from earths perspective, the moon is just as small as the distance to the sun is long - it's given it's size and orbit, in the perfect place. That's one hell of a coincidence, isn't it? It really really is, we're the only known configuration that has anything remotely close to that.

If we ever meet some genuine aliens, we could open up a tourist attraction! "See the exotic moon of Earth as it covers the sun EXACTLY!"
I'm sure it would warrant an entry in the Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy.

What's also cool about the moon, is that it rotates at the exact right speed so that the same side always faces earth. "The dark side of the moon" is a genuine thing. Not saying this is in any way proof or that I believe it myself, just saying.

I don't plan to. I've been archiving every mecha raw I can get my hands on and uploading them to mediafire. I'm uploading Laserion right now and I uploaded Danguard Ace last week.

I'm part of a recently formed sub group (last-month-recent) created mainly to finish Toshou Daimos, and Liger has been discussed as a potential future project. I can't give you any promises since I'm just a timer and this might just be a pipe dream but it's a thought.

^Also has Onibaku's subs for episodes 1 and 2. I got them THE day before the megapocalypse hit. I retimed them from Onibaku's god awful quality raw that had tons of blocking and artifacting and put them with the high quality raw I got from the torrent. That was my first time timing anything so I didn't know about snapping to keyframes and shit when I did it and it probably doesn't have the best styles, but it should do you.

Hey guys, this is probably the last time you'll see me post with this trip here.

Two years ago, I subbed Kamen Rider Kuuga and I'm pretty much ready to stop this entire subbing thing. The original plan was to quit after Kuuga but you guys know how that went. So today, I'm pretty much quiting subbing entirely so I can continue my life outside of it.

Ok, that's enough ego. I brought you guys something. I subbed that recently released of Kamen Rider Kuuga MV as a last release. Thought it would be fitting to start and end with Kuuga. Consider it my final gift to you guys and to the toku fandom that has brought me a lot of joy over the years. Enjoy.

Added tracks include Original themes (both Wars and World versions), the rest of the Wing theme songs, Asemu's SUPER PILOT theme (two versions because I couldn't make up my mind where in the song I wanted the BGM to start) and some assorted BGMs from Wars, World, EXVS and SRWZ.

Here's the one used for Milliardo and Dorothy, using the song from the actual OST, looped for a stupidly long time (just short of 6 minutes). So I guess it would work for an EXVS custom soundtrack track too.

The one used for masked Zechs was the second half of "Gundam Attack" from the 1st OST.

Maybe I'll do more loops and put them into a .rar like someone else did.

I'm pretty sure the Pixiv artist is going go through most if not all emblems that Muv-Luv has. Here's his page http://www.pixiv.net/member.php?id=605652
I'm sure some /m/en are working on some of the patches, like the one who fixed Valkylies.

Well I just beat the game. All of it. Including the extra hell missions. Here's some tips.
-For the EX missions you only have to kill the giant white cannon thing that has 30k health to win.
-The Last Hell stage will break your balls into two. You will HAVE to have units dishing out 20k+ damage to every unit to even have a chance at winning.
-Beating all the stages buys every pilot that you have unlocked for you/
-The final boss is a red looking Halphas Gundam with a coat, I'll take a picture of it. Beating the final boss unlocks the original suits like Master Phoeinx and Shin Knight Gundam for development.
-Turn A Black History is not the final boss, there's no 'true' Qanta and there's no ELS Setsuna.
That's all there is. I'll try to upload a save file to mediafire since I've got all the units unlocked.

Here's a little gift for those that got Custom BGMs to work. These tracks are all gotten from the Wars and World OSTs, except for Mobile Game, Banshee, GX Dashing Out, the two Generation of CE themes and the AGE themes, which are from the original OSTs. I'm using 6.20 Pro B10 on a PSP2000 and they all work for me.

You're kinda in luck, the guy who I got the Arabic RAW from uploaded the full series to mediafire.

http://pastebin.com/eh2cFGbx

Just a warning, there are some bits where there's no audio, these were cut out by the networks so that the show would fit the time slot and they could sneak in more commercials.

I'd also appreciate it if someone could make a torrent for this. I'd love to grab the full series, but DDLs can be such a hassle sometimes.

So, as a bit of a cultural exchange, I decided to go ahead and sub an episode of KOUSOKU DENJIN ALBEGAS.

I gave the sub files the appropriate name, so just put them in the same folder as the video and it should be play.

Intro: http://www.mediafire.com/?q1emy1spfq211ln
Intro Subs: http://www.mediafire.com/?1jkul4dknjdyfq4

Episode 1: http://www.mediafire.com/?1cxcknn8p8l4nxz
Episode 1 subs: http://www.mediafire.com/?a77xtftvi80ijpk

A warning for anyone who is going to watch this.

1. This IS the Arabic release, I wasn't able to get the Japanese audio for this and I wouldn't have been able to translate that, the script is different.
2. This isn't my encode, whoever did this ripped the Japanese DVDs, slapped on the Arabic dub, and cut out parts that the Arabic edition of the show didn't have, but they also hardsubbed some "RIPPED BY" credits at the beginning that I couldn't remove. Sorry.
3. The dialogue and the dubbing is pretty inconsistent and is kinda funny to hear. I'm sure most of you will get a few laughs out of how bad it can get.
4. I probably won't do much beyond the OP and the first episode, unless people are interested in it. This really isn't the best way to watch the show, but I don't see any alternatives so I'll do it if people want to.

I'm sure most of you won't like it, so I decided to include something extra perspective in my next post to make this thread worth your time.

No, not really. The anime spoils quite a lot that makes the VN good, and the VN actually shows the alternative world vastly superior because of the medium. The VN is the better of the two even with its flaws.

EPISODE.24: HUMILIATION AT BAIKAL (5)

The Gundam pilots, now isolated on Earth, get word of a transport involving Taurus space-use mobile suits to the Baikal base. However, would the route be via land or air? While Quatre and the Maguanac team quickly attacked a transport train, it turned out to be a decoy. the Gundam Heavyarms launches an attack on a transport plane carrying Taurus suits as Heero in the Wing Gundam appears and continues on ahead. There, he comes under attack by Zechs in the Tallgeese. Just then, as the two engage in a deadly battle, Lady Une makes a daring move. With the colonies taken as hostages, what will Heero’s next move be?!

In other news, Mediafire is randomly assigning strikes to my account and taking down a majority of my links citing copyright claims from third party sources (thus far Wing's compilation volumes and the Crossbone Ghost ones). But, they aren't naming the source of said claims like they have in the past. I need to look into alternative file sharing means in the future if this continues.

The reason why A4 version has them on their side is because the scan quality of the pictures isn't the best. A5 is better in this regard, as the images are large enough to be fitted on a spread. I'll replace the pictures if anyone manages to get better scans, or if I ever get my hands on the actual things.

I've made a test version of A5 version, and I'd like you to give it a look and say if this looks better in your eyes.

Did you get the collectors CD version for DOS?

Also, mount the CD in daemon tools(or whatever you use) and make the virtual drive the lowest drive letter possible (I use D) because the DOS emulator checks the lowest drive for the disc, that way you can get the voice overs.

You bring up a nice point but I'm already ahead of you! The only reason I began this project was I found a zip file with all the Italian subs in srt format. I'm using it as a back up check whenever I don't understand anything. The only reason I'm not translating that directly is because it's a 2nd level translation again and I believe they are dubtitles. They sometimes say completely different things to what the dialogue is talking about.

GoogleiqdbSauceNAO [RHS] Platinumhugen Ordian - 01 (...).jpg, 55 kB, 640x480
Anonymous Tue Sep 25 2012 19:40:56 No.8267961 ViewReport	
So as I understand it /m/ - There are subs for a show called Platinumhugen Ordian, but the quality of [A-Keep]'s subs are not very good. One of the biggest complaints I hear about this show is that: it doesn't make a lick of sense. Having seen the level of translation quality of the first few episodes I can understand why. Now I'm not going to say this is an amazing show, but I get the feeling that, what is otherwise labelled as a really bad show by most people, it is probably an average show with some good points and some bad points.

In an effort to try and understand what's going on I decided to translate episode one myself. I've also gone and used a better quality DVDrip raw and made it a softsubbed mkv.

The only other thing to note is I'm not all that confident of my own Japanese in a scene or two and I'd love it if someone with better Japanese took over and carried on in my place. Any one willing to give it a shot?

I'm putting this out there to raise some awareness nonetheless.

[RHS] Platinumhugen Ordian - 01 [C1AB8CAD].mkv - http://www.mediafire.com/?rqx1a99a12f7788

I'll probably do episode 2 as well. Any way to give an idea of how bad the original subs were, I'll post some comparison images in the following posts.

There have been a lot of mentions recently, both here and other places, of the original MSG novels. I found a version floating around and started reading. Let me just say: Holy Shit, these are good.

The downside, however, was that this ebook version I found was riddled with errors. Being the OCD man-child that I am, I have corrected the worst of these, as documented here.

1) Replaced all instaces of "Gun-dam" with "Gundam"
2) Replaced all instaces of "psychom" with "psycommu"
3) Replaced the word "son" with "daughter" when referring to Mineva Zabi
4) Removed random numbers from the middle of words.
5) Replaced the God-awful collage cover of the original epub with the God-awful cover from the 2004 dead-tree omnibus edition (seen at left)

Other than the above, I left the text as I found it. I'm fairly certian, however, that there are still OCR-derived errors such as numbers or other symbols in place of letters. If this bothers you, learn how to edit epub files and fix it yourself.

So far as I can tell, there is no official ebook version of these books, but in the event that one becomes availible, I will immediately take this file down, and replace it with that one.

Share and Enjoy.

Lets see...
>Have you finished all the routes in Extra and Unlimited?
Nope, before playing unlimited i finished just the Meiya and Sumika routes. But right now im finishing the Class Rep one and i dont know why but im feeling really sad for her story. I guess ALT just broke my emotions control
>So who is your favourite Maburabu? 
I'll be honest. I cant decide who's my favorite. Its like everyone its my favorite. Except Ayamine... i dont like her as much as the others, but i guess its because i haven't played any of her routes.
>And which is your favourite arc?
Yokohama arc. Mah nigger... all of that despair... all of that PTSD inducing Beta raping..
>Also, what do you think you'll do next. 
I just watched Chicken Divers. Shit was so cash! Most of side stories are off-limits to me, as i dont speak moonrunes. I'm reading some TSFIA thanks to the mediafire folder (>>8242946 thanks for the great job!)
Also, i hope the AE and Chronicles fantranlations will be completed someday.
I already convinced two of my friends to read ML, one of them is finishing alternative these days. The other one will finish the Phoenix Wright trilogy before reading this one.

I've only read the first volume so far so I can't say much of anything. At first it's just Sayaka, Jun and Hikaru playing Charlie's Angels with robots, with Maria joining later, and it's pretty boring and kinda stupid going overboard with the whole "tit weapons" gimmick. But skimming through the rest of the volumes it seems to get better later, I need to make some time to continue reading it.

The raws are still here if you want, I shared them a long time ago.

And what are you youngsters talking about in this thread??
OH HO!

Ahh, yeah.. it was a bit surprising to wake up to a billion mails and whatnot (I'll have to go through those all later). These things happen though, and I really should have thought in advance and put a timecode or watermark stating that it's unfinished or something on it. Obviously, I don't mind people seeing it (that's kind of the point)... but when it's done and actually has some continuity. Still, uber foolishness on my part, I think!

The guy wasn't being an asshole though. I don't think he meant any harm, and there are a few other ones up as well now so I think it's too late to try and get them taken down, as more will just spring up. Maybe the heat will die down though.

I reckon the best thing for future updates is to mediafire link them here (with a big THIS SHIT IS UNFINISHED plastered on the video just in case, as >>8234956 said).

It's a tricky one, as although I could just go off and do the rest on my own and then post it when it's finished, the animation is legitimately much better with input (it looks much better now that the first version). So I'll just keep showing the updates here I reckon, as long as people don't get sick and tired of it!

I tell you what though, there are literally face-smashing waves of goodwill flying at me from pretty much everyone, lots of emails wishing me all the best etc. People really can be exceptionally cool sometimes, and it is much appreciated.
Thanks very much, /m/en. I'll buy you all Char helmets when I'm rich.

Good news on the Lost Plamo scanning front (and possibly for future scanning). The tech guy at work said it's cool if I want to use the serious business sheet feed scanner to scan the book, but it emails it to him then he forwards it to me. Assuming it can scan well and there's no issues with getting HUEG files around I should be done by the end of the week.

There's your nationalism, go suck a dick.


By my amateur ass reckoning Yamamoto just said Yokohama, assuming the line was ???????????????. It's a bit awkward to word that in English to get the slight towards Yokohama and the fact it was Yokohama made in without another word. Personally I think if you know the setting it still makes sense without adding company. (since Yokohama can only refer to one thing at this point)

Other than that really not bad from CR this week besides the usual terms and a couple silly typos. Plus I learned a line break in the middle of EM Radiation Cannon means find and replace will miss it.

>How do I install this shit?
Use UMDGen to open your ISO. Extract the C01.CPK to the Patch folder (With xDelta.exe in it)
Run the UsePatch.bat
Rename the C01 Translated.cpk to C01.CPK
Drag and drop the C01.CPK (Your translated one) into the same folder as the original on UMDGen.
It'll ask if you want to replace it with your new one, hit yes.
Save as a new ISO.
Put the ISO on your PSP and enjoy.

>What's Translated?
Item names, Parts names, Materials, Dropped Tech, Weapon Skills, Unit names, All pilot names, 90% of the menus, All weapons, all Pilot Skills, and more.

>Which version is this for?
Universe Accel. HOWEVER, in theory it should work on Cosmic Drive as well, I have not tested it yet though.

>Can I use this with a save from my untranslated version?
YES! You in fact can.

>What doesn't work?
Nothing. Everything works in this version.

>When will a new version be out?
I'm hoping to pop out weekly builds if not sooner. We'll see though it depends on how things progress.

>I found a problem!
Great! Post it here. Screenshot if you can and how you came across it. If it's not translated let me know and I'll look for it.

Between Naenara and DPRK I could probably do this for 150 posts every day and I'd still not have to do repeats. They don't run out, but it's not exactly original.
Like a story about a new stamp contains almost the exact same wording a the last story about a stamp and closely resembles the book Stamps Of The Dear Leader.

As far as I can tell it's mostly picked up by The Glorious Peoples' Revolutionary Front Of The Dorm Common Room type people.

They responded badly. Some people believe the old guy who "retired" recently was part of a purge of elements who were scapegoated internally for the failure. But they really painted themselves into a corner by bringing reporters in rather than handing the AP film and a press release.
While there's certainly no freedom and the death camps are still running full steam, it seems that KJU's group don't have their shit together anywhere near as well as KJI did.

If anybody's interested in their media I got a few dubbed DPRK docus up at http://www.mediafire.com/?7a6jmhr14486i . Last I saw there was a ton of A Squirrel And Hedgehog on youtube, also. In one episode either squirrel or hedgehog is infiltrating the robot base of a running-dog lackey of the brigandish imperialists, and when confronted challenges the lackey and beats him at an RTS.

KNG, guy who ripped his Muv-Luv Prelude 2.0 disc last week here.
I logged into my MediaFire account a few minutes ago in order to upload it only to receive a Demand for Immediate Take-Down filled by someone acting on behalf of Toei regarding a GaoGaiGar CD that I ripped and uploaded 5 years ago...
Did you get something similar for your old files?

Okay, I got through the first few minutes of a (very) rough version.
I threw an mp3 together to try it in mpc with the dub option.
I'm starting to get an idea of how to go about doing this effectively. Looks like the best results will be to source from moon wherever possible. I still have to work on balancing the levels better and lots of other stuff.

I rather like it a lot. It's a good story and I fell in love with the characters, having tons of fun along the way.

From a technical stand point it blows away all the VNs I've read, even the Type Moon ones.

It has it's share of issues (they kinda got lazy during the Original Hive Operation) but over all it's an excellent franchise.

So my niggs, I've been doing some work. A lot of work actually. Like 20+ hours into this damn thing already. What does that mean? Well it means you should be expecting a V0.6 of this translation patch this weekend. Probably Saturday or Sunday, hell maybe even Friday night if I REALLY start cranking out and find the material names.
The V0.6 patch will most likely be a full ISO and will be uploaded to some file sharing site, maybe MediaFire. Not sure yet.
Until then I'll be slaving away still. Tally ho!

And I also know jack shit about how to make an MKV, I tried a converter, it didn't include the subs. But there's a set of DVD-rip raws on nyaa that I used as the basis. I've started timing episode 2 but, again, I'd be happy for some help if anyone is interested.

Those aren't scrubs, actually. Those are rips of the TV-N scripts. One can tell by popping it open in even Notepad, where they'll find remains of TV-N's terrible effects and a translation that's crap even compared to the Hulu subs. Not only that, but they go out of sync towards the end of the series.

Sweet! Thanks again. Downloaded 'em, resampled them to 300dpi, and saved them as JPeGs. They're now available for download in a single ZIPped archive here:

http://www.mediafire.com/?n4g6c4c1kw5f6sl

I'll crop them and remove any Moiré patterns later. For now, they're at least a manageable size.

Enjoy, all!

The anime or the game? If the game, the mediafire link posted earlier has Latest Edition, which I downloaded for myself today. I had also been on a hunt for it awhile ago and I managed to download the DVD version and the fandisk. But now those are obsolete.

Also if you're re-upping these to file sharing sites resplit them into new split archives, that way file sharing sites don't just label it another copy of the existing file.

You can try using these together if you want. Be warned though that TV-N's translation IS kinda bad on this. Off the top of my head I recall one scene where Proist asks Dick how much sugar he wants in his coffee, and the subs said "how many homes can a person have" or some other senseless thing. It's probably not the only mistake they made.

The Gundam pilots, now isolated on Earth, get word of a transport involving Taurus space-use mobile suits to the Baikal base. However, would the route be via land or air? While Quatre and the Maguanac team quickly attacked a transport train, it turned out to be a decoy. Meanwhile, the real transport approached the base. However, the Gundam Heavyarms appeared and launched an attack! Now, the legendary unit Tallgeese makes its appearance. Will the Tallgeese’s lance pierce the Wing Gundam?!

The Actor who plays the commander role in a Sentai Hero series stops a man from taking a voyeur video of a high school girl (08/26 17:20)
The Sentai Hero's Commander has a very active life outside of television. He was able to seize a voyeur trying to take a video secretly.

According to the police, the actor and director Hideo Sakaki (42 years old) saw a suspicious man standing behind a school girl at a book store in the Setagaya district of Tokyo.
Mr. Hideo who caught the suspect: "He was taking a video from underneath her skirt. I didn't think he would try to run away, but I instinctively started to chase him."
The suspect caught red-handed is a taxi driver named Tetsuya Kawakami (60 years old). He has been arrested for investigation. Mr. Sakaki plays the role of Commander Takeshi Kuroki in the TV Asahi series "Tokumei Sentai Gobusters".
Mr. Hideo Sakaki who caught the suspect: "I would have done the same thing in any situation. I would like to ask the suspect not to try this again. I would like to say: Shut-down Complete"

Well, good thing I was reminded the railgun is full auto anyways. There's nothing in the VN segment to really give that impression, and the fact they had Nigata CRANK DEM ENGINES for the ungodful railgun recoil was nice.

I ripped the HK subs off of the DVDs since they were hardsubbed on BBT. They need a lot of work though, a lot of time-fixing and scrubbing, preferably by someone who knows at least a little moonspeak. Would be better if someone did a whole new sub but it could be years to never before that happens.

So if anyone wants to fix 'em up a little.

>>Sendspace delete after 30 days of inactivity, so not ideal, but we do post some links when the files are under 300meg
>>Mediafire has been deleting accounts recently involved with mass sharing of videos, also they are a target of the MPAA/FBI witch hunt, so its not advisable to use them

>>We are only a small group so making a mass of new links is very hard given we all work for a living and have limited bandwidth at times to do uploading, its more a case of only reuploading when all links are dead and gone, other than that we just let them tick along, not much we can do about the slow download speeds from sites, but with less and less bandwidth available since everybody is trying to use the sites, it makes it hard to get a good decent stable server that is out in the public domain.

I'd almost go far enough to say that CG can be seen as a form of modern claymation , as they share the same basic idea of "build the model, then animate it."

Whether or not they can actually make them mesh CG into animation or live footage is really dependant on the studios' intents. They managed to mesh live footage, matte paintings and models in Blade Runner's opening, and I have a careful belief towards the studios and their staff that they will strife to make CG work as intended.

And the embarrassing attempts will most likely stay as long as the directors etc think themselves as artists rather than craftsmen, but that's another thing altogether.
However, if the industries keep learning and understanding the CG at the same speeding pace they have, attempts will become nearly extinct outside when trying something new.

Quite frankly, if you're this desperate the .ass files I posted should be fine.

So no more mecha max from my mediafire directory. Logged into my mf and got a takedown notice about it credited in part to funimation. Keep sucking that Japanese corporate dick, funi, it'll make it that much better when they throw your ass away.

I'll make a new rip and throw it somewhere else if anybody wants, but somehow I don't think that ParaPara albums from ten years ago are too much in demand.

Any Detachments containing a Unit and/or Character with Combat Modifiers containing an 's' are considered a Sound Force, and they have a pretty sweet ability to limit the enemy's options even further when they deal damage. Details in the Zip file for the set.

No, until recently they couldn't be found anywhere at all. I figured they were lost from the internet forever but some guy uploaded and posted the link to mediafire a week or two ago I think.

Plus half-subbed stuff from dead groups never stays seeded very good anyway. 1-2 seeds max downloadin' at 20 kb/s usually.

TO BE CLEAR: THIS IS UNEDITED. Translator is gone, and I have no idea about the following: "Dinasour brains", "Downdead engines", "Lion's cub inside a Lion" and why they refer to the Vectora as an "Outer System AIRCRAFT carrier".

I just really want to get it out there, maybe inspire someone to finish it. I will not be doing anymore.

Ok, first you need to find the .craft in your KSP folder. It'll be under KSP,ships, SPH. To post the .craft file you need to put it on a file sharing site like mediafire and then just post the link in your post on the Spacecraft Exchange forum. Just title it Core Fighter from Gundam or something. Again, nice job.

This one was labled as Zeta Gundam, probably because of the base jabber which they fucking loved in Zeta. But that blur on top is a Jesta.

Ok, first you need to find the .craft in your KSP folder. It'll be under KSP,ships, SPH. To post the .craft file you need to put it on a file sharing site like mediafire and then just post the link in your post on the Spacecraft Exchange forum. Just title it Core Fighter from Gundam or something. Again, nice job.

I think this is actually the first time the original scanner mislabled something.

This one was labled as Zeta Gundam, probably because of the base jabber which they fucking loved in Zeta. But that blur on top is a Jesta.

Everything that you need to start can be found here:
http://www.mediafire.com/?uj4dnnin9835p

Read Extra (only Meiya and Sumika routes are compulsory for unlocking Unlimited but I recommend reading every routes), then read Unlimited (your favorite character's route first, then the others in the order you see fit) and finish with Alternative (no routes here).

You might also want to watch (as the VN is not fully translated) the Kimi ga Nozomu Eien anime, followed by the Akane Maniax OVA (which leads directly into Muv-Luv Extra) before starting Extra.
Keep Ayumayu Theater for after you finish Alternative.

no. Sorry.
Odds are whatever is online will be better than anything I'd make. I had sorta successfully capped some of my Korean Street Fighter II tapes (it's in http://www.mediafire.com/?8xaf144y08j44 in the files), and since then I've gotten another usb capture thing, but I need to actually set it up right and do it in a good program instead of Windows Movie Whatever.
But between the often meh quality of US lds and my own ineptness with it you're better off with whatever's already out there.

That reminds me, though, I need to copy the moonspeak audio from Lensman.

For starters: Although a good chunk of these are still megaupload links, and some of the others are dead a good chunk of stuff can be found here:

http://mechamediaarchive.blogspot.ca/search/label/gundam

...Also.

This seems as good a thread as any to announce this:

My archive drive just died. 3 terabytes of data, just gone. I basically lost everything I've ever posted. I have some newer stuff, but everything I downloaded off of Share, PD etc was on that drive.

So, I'm in the process of downloading all the stuff I ever posted to mediafire and other websites.

I have a favour to ask, though. If you have something I posted to megaupload, or anywhere else where it's likely to have been taken down, can you reup it? Stuff like the Area 88 raws or the F91 manga.

Please...?

Lieutenant Shin Matsunaga makes his appearance on the battlefield once again, much to the surprise of his former subordinates. As the Gwazine forces push back the attacking Federation mobile suits, several members are bitter about his absence from Solomon and believe he's responsible for the death of Dozle Zabi. Soon afterwards, Shin stands before Lady Zena, prepared to receive his judgment for being a fool and not doing more to try and save His Excellency. Instead of lashing out at him, Lady Zena implores Shin to escape with them... but why?

I have 1-42 already, the ddl links are dead for 43,44,45. Did someone reupload those already? I didn't watch much of this but I'd like to start over again.

Might upload them to mediafire when the subs are done.
Just a few more ep right?

You can download them from TKNG's mf folder:

or search on piratebay or something, there's a short installation guide on TKNG's folder that I've linked before.

If your V-22 doesn't appear in the UL/Altverse, then it's staying out.
Just kidding, but I need a good image for the Osprey, and a good description that doesn't involve "The Mitsurugis use it in silly rich people games!"

As well as another person to download and upload anime screenshots. I'm just having very poor luck with anything that isn't mediafire recently.

I think you meant Kamen Rider J, as well. Which IS a good suggestion, together with Kamen Rider ZO. Both of them are fairly short (40 minutes or so) self contained movies and are both really good. They're available here: http://megaanon.wordpress.com/

Grown Ups In Spandex, aka GUIS, just finished their Jetman sub. Jetman is generally regarded as one of the best Sentai EVER so you might want to check that out.

For full Kamen Rider shows I'd suggest Black, fully subbed by Century Kings, for Showa. Thing is, the guy got banned from mediafire so I dunno where/if you can get the whole series. For Heisei, Kuuga is the way to go, available here: http://midnightcrewsubs.blogspot.com.ar/search/label/Kuuga

Kuuga is another really well regarded series and probably the most fun I ever had with a toku show. It is straight up amazing and it'll make you hate Decade for what it did to Kuuga.

After reading the translations for the AkibaRanger Crusade Set, I realized I have to go back through all the sets I've done so far, and add Rarity values. So I figured while I did that, I'd also provide the normal and parallel versions of cards that have them.

So far, Dynamic Crusade has been reuploaded with these updates. Feel free to use what you have, or redownload to use as a reference.

I am working on the other sets with this update, as well as working to get AkibaCrusade done.

Deep in the bowels of the Original Hive (aka age main office or Kouki's house, pick one), there exists a magical tool. Miyata, fool as he was, knew not to cross it, and his impeccable penning skills were gifted him by that tool when he sacrificed his own stock in imitation of Kouki's monthly rituals.

But that's not our business. In the meantime, have the wonderchest that is Kiminozo Guy's ML CG collection.

AMERICA would turn to worshipping one-dimensional cannot-fail-cannot-die super-powered heroes if they were the ones buttfucked by people dressed in faux banana skins screaming incoherent bloody murder.

But actually, you kinda forgot that close-combat training is part and parcel of all armed forces, especially those with commandos as part of them. It's just that in ML, it's more economical to hit with a sword rather than the butt of a rifle that could be used to output x2 the amount of bullets.

That, and we're kinda not talking about "our-world" Japan, who largely abandoned imperialism, it's "their-world" Japan, who swallowed shame and was allowed, apart from keeping their sword collector's obsession, a great deal of other things, including a larger military force, navy, and generally more autonomy rather than lobotomy.

Here, /m/, have a Shin Matsunaga comic.

WHITE WOLF OF RAINBOWS.I

There was once a man called the White Wolf of Solomon. A man who was even said to be the right hand man of Vice Admiral Dozle Zabi, the commander of the Principality of Zeon's Space Assault Force. The year 0079 of the Universal Century was a year painted with death and destruction, all in the name of Zeon's war for independence. So how did that man live through those times? This is the story that traces his paths...

The Tripods (unabridged audiobooks)
Raul "Otter Marquis" Johansen Thu Jul 19 2012 16:50:58 No.8009475 ViewReport	
Hello, /m/. Definitely not Paul "OtaKing" Johnson here.

All four of The Tripods books are up in audiobook form on Demonoid at:
http://www.demonoid.me/files/?category=17&subcategory=All&quality=All&seeded=0&exter
nal=2&query=the+tripods&uid=0&sort=

I just thought some of you might like to listen to them, as they're classics of /m/ literature. I'm seeding as well so they should come down quickly. I was hoping to upload them to Mediafire or somewhere but they're about 260mb per book and too big...

If you don't know about the Tripods, it's a trilogy (and a prequel book that was written after) written in 1967 about the future Earth ruled by giant alien Tripod machines (they could be sentient machines, or there could be things inside pilotting them. It's one of the mysteries that is uncovered along the way). They have subjugated mankind and regressed technology back to feudal times, and everyone has to have a mind-control device implanted onto their skull at age 14, which makes the population placid and accepting of being ruled by giant mechs.

It's supposedly a series for children, but being written in the late 60s is about as different from Harry Potter and The Hunger Games as you can imagine really, with actual good writing, plenty of violence and lines like "Horror, above all, at how closely I had come to falling - no - to throwing myself into something beside which suicide was clean and good."
So higher level literature than "Harry Potter felt sad."

Give them a listen. The narrator is very good (I'm 3/4s through the first book and loving it).

Muv Luv Alternative artbook "Integral Works". It's only partially scanned and untranslated. Someone should have the mediafire link. Easily worth the money buying it though and even with a basic knowledge of Japanese you can glean a lot of info like the laser class range charts.

The manga has been translated in full, courtesy of Xros Raws and company. The dialogue is contained in text files, but the page numbers and speaking characters are labeled for easy following along. The scanslation project is still going to happen in the future, if you absolutely cannot deal with having to open text files independent of the raws to read the manga.

>OK I "think" I've found where the magic numbers are in each file. I think. They all start with THSS and then a few characters and then DXT. Then a few lines down is the file name without an extension and then a few more spaces and giberish (probably the image data) though I can't find any file types that work or match the "magic Numbers".
>Also they all end with FHSS. (46 48 53 53)

THSS seems to be a header string, and FHSS seems to be the end of file string. How big are these files? Would you mind compressing a few and putting it on mediafire so I could take a look instead of just offering random advice?

It's some other alpha-related manga by that dude. There's slightly silly things like Alberto getting into a Mobile Fighter and getting some sort of a beam cigar, and then there's awesome things like Mars throwing down with Big Fire, pic very related.
>but how does that even
Don't question it!

I have no idea if it fits in with Steel Messiah somehow, but there it is. And yeah, it goes Rai MkII to Rai Kanketsuhen so I'm not sure if there was something before this.

Yo, buddy, still alive?

Got some Steel Messiah here. What's Steel Messiah? Well some of you might remember seeing a comic where Sanger was going full I AM THE SWORD OF MAGUS and a load of characters were going full tilt just trying to slow him down. That's from Steel Messiah. That translated bit wasn't even the full chapter that. And it's actually part of an overarching story involving all your favourite shows, or at least the ones that got into Alpha Gaiden. Plus a good handful of originals. Expect to see lots of Sanger, then Irui and BIG FIRE. But there's plenty of great crossovers here.

At least I think I've got all of Steel Messiah there.

>dead links, dead links everywhere
I have some reuploading to do.

Here's some stuff that's pretty unrelated, I believe it's backstory on the Choujikin? Maybe you're amused because oh hey it's that Grims guy, maybe you're interested because Son Ganlong, maybe you're not interested but give it a look while I reupload some Steel Messiah. Also it's got the other two Choujikin which aren't really something we've seen aside from their inclusion in OG2nd. Pic related.

Two questions /m/. Hoping you can help me out here.

(1) Are there scans for the original Astray manga? If so, who did them?

(2) Does anyone have download links for Zeonic-Corps scanlation of X Astray? They aren't available on the ZC website for some reason and all Mediafire and Rapidshare links I've found of them are down.

Sailor Moon OP 1&2
MegaWikiAnon !!SR4r2NLZDot Fri Jul 06 2012 20:40:42 No.7960051 ViewReport	
Sometimes when you get bored you do weird things. When I get bored I either stare at a wall, or I sub something really random. In this case it was a few months back and I had the Sailor Moon theme stuck in my head. Well after a while I snapped, found a RAW, and subbed it. Now, this was something that was never supposed to be released. Actually, I thought I had deleted it but nope, it was just hidden away on my HDD. I figured with the recent announcement of a reboot Sailor Moon anime coming out in 2013 that “Why not? I put time and effort into this. Maybe someone will appreciate it.” So included in this .zip is the first two openings which both use the same song “Moonlight Densetsu”but they each have different visuals so I couldn’t pick just one. As far as Sailor Moon goes my only exposure to it half of the Toku (it’s on my “to watch” list), the Sailor V manga (I’m a sucker for Sailor Venus), and this song. I’ve never actually seen the anime. I think that makes me a terrible person. But oh well. Enjoy!

A word of caution: These videos are the first time I messed around with stuff like “fading” and “font color”. So if something fucked up, let me know!

Most of the episodes are on Mediafire I think. Look at the file list on Bakabt and try copy and pasting the random numbers at the end of the files names into Google, that should lead you straight to any DDL.

So, Osamu Tezuka's Buddha anime movie subs are finally out... Except they're from Malaysian DVDs. Anyway, I edited the subs. It's not perfect, but at least they're better than the Malaysian bootleg. If you can report any mistakes you find, that'd be great too.

If the guy was legitimately guilty, he should do time, if he was legitimately innocent, he shouldn't. The way the FBI/media seems to have blown the whole thing up into a huge shitstorm is what got me: if they're making this level of kerfuffle over it, then I feel like the FBI is trying to cover up the fact it has hardly any footing against the guy. According to a quick google, the guy is taunting the law for trying to arrest him, s IMO, he's asking for it now. and his name is Dotcom, which is blatantly legally-changed rather than born with. Seems like this guy is a walking pile of douchebaggery

Aside form that, that whole case was tl;dr, and doesn't really involve me too much so fuck it. I always preferred MediaFire for some reason anyway. Probably the wrong attitude to have but you know, some random site admin gets fucked by the FBI, meh

>>7918556
Yeh, that bit does sound like 'Public. Please, sue our asses to infinity.' but its the government forcing the ISPs hand. Bastards. There isn't much more cowardly in this world than using a scapegoat

It'll probably stop when the president gets his door kicked in for watching a youtube video that just so happens to have one song by one pissy artist as its BGM.

There's literally only one upside to all of this, that I can think of: All of the 'bronies' in the UK will have no way to watch the show I think. Dunno if there's a certain Sky channel it airs on, but it'd put a fucking huge dent in the fanbase at least

http://www.mediafire.com/view/?k69fpdrk67ao5fq is a transcription I've done of most of the book. I think the only major difference between 0099 and Popular Edition is the change of language and that one page I posted being missing.

In case anyone's interested;
here's the PS2 game.

http://www.mediafire.com/?g8u2atrb0rrcj

Pretty fun. Plays like an RPG for the most part. You can level up relationships with other characters which in turn can change who Noriko's copilot is. That in turn affects what attacks you can unlock. There's an action portion too.

Pretty fun. Plays like an RPG with relationship levels (that can determine who you can get as a co-pilot which affects what attacks you can get) in the intermissions and an action game for the chunk of it.

Hello.
I'm just reading this short novel that came with the Tie Fighter 1994 game. It's here if you want it

http://www.mediafire.com/?pcpx455tnwja8bn

Though certainly not high tier literature, it's pretty cool stuff if you want to actually read about what it's like inside a Star Destroyer (there are stores and leisure centers apparenly, a bit like the SDF-1), and spotting enemies in space from the ambient light of suns glinting off the metal when your sensors don't work.

I'm only partway in but it seems like a decent enough light read, and the only thing that deals with life on a Star Destroyer. The guy has just started his Tie Fighter training so I expect paragraphs on dual-linking laser fire and boosting engine power. It's kind of Bodacious Space Pirates with its talk of technical shit so far.

Finally finished volume 5 of the guyver manga
i very unhappy with this scan, being the moron that i am, I didn't realize that i was scanning in the highest quality possible, so each pic was about 11 mb so in another bone head manuever i tried to reduced the file size to be able to upload it to mediafire. and the quailty is passable but not by much.
anyway this is vol 5 of the guyver manga, it's a crude scan cause i didn't want to destroy my copy but that started happening towards the end. same as before viz release copy, names are gonna be off and left to right. and the quality is low.....

Well, lately I've become interested in playing/reading Fushigi no Umi no Nadia ~Inherit the Blue Water~ (just your usual short and concise Japanese title) but unfortunately I can't find the Japanese PC version, torrent, Share and Emule failed on me, I've only found the PS2 version and the (traditional) Chinese PC version. By any chance, does anyone happen to have it? It was posted ages ago on Share but I can't find a complete file while on emule there's someone sharing it but I just can't connect to him, the torrent is dead of course.
Anyway I can post the PS2 version for those interested in it:

Anyways, I really enjoyed PL episode 12. It's pretty impressive how a mecha show can do a whole episode without any mechs in it at all, and still be carried by the strength of its characters. You don't see that often.

Looks like I too, have gotten the Jeeg autosage curse. Let's try this again!

In this episode Bandora recruits the Scorpion Warrior Lami to further strengthen her army, the Zyurangers race to retrieve those Dinosaur Eggs (Again!), there’s some dancing, and Burai just doesn’t care one bit, he just wants his revenge. Also, Geki does something awesome that puts him in my book of favorite Reds. Seriously, he’s an awesome person and a true badass.

Anyways, it’s another great episode and Lami is pretty awesome. She’s got an interesting taste in Men. Interesting? Maybe weird is the better term. I really like her costume, it’s a nice blend of human and monster. She’s played by Kawai Ami who, according to Wikipedia, had roles in Jiban, Solbrain, Kakuranger, and B-Fighter.

Enjoy the episode and we’ll be back next week!

Time flows onward. It does not stop for even a single moment. The "Walkure" as well as the "Rheingold" have taken on important roles within this circle of time ... and are only resting for a while.
The circle ...yes, within the eternal "ring of time"... ...this tale will continue until the past and future touch ... ...consequently, people call this tale "The Nibelungen Ring" .....

Hey, /m/, the scanlators caught up with the Evangelion manga. End of Evangelion time!

We've got some extra history on Shinji. Apparently he lived with his mom's big brother.

Also he's actually REALLY GOOD AT DRAWING.

And they didn't like him, interesting!

I hope the cool Evabros come out for this thread and not the waifufags. I mean, waifufaggotry is nice and all, but Eva waifufags are terrible.

So let's hope for no:
>REBUILD IS SHIT AND SHAT ON ASUKA'S CHARACTER

Speed Hard Cap: 24.9
Note: You get more out of your custom points for AGI, HP, SPD but less for OC.

Q. Is there hard caps for other stats?
A. No.

Q. What does Agility affect?
A. Higher Agility shortens animations like stopping a boost, changing direction, starting a boost, etc. The speed of melee and projectiles are not affected.

Q. What servers are /m/ on?
A. NA mainly. Some of us are on KR and SEA though.

Note, if you're a new player don't be concerned about learning how to do advanced techniques. Focus on learning tactics, taking cover, maneuvering, and teamwork. B ranks are good to start off with because your mistakes are cushioned a bit. C ranks are also worth trying if you want to train spartan style.

Nyaa has torrents, but I don't think there are any seeds on the older episodes.

This site has mediafires and it's where I grabbed the episodes the other night, but they've got low video quality probably so they could fit on mediafire. If you just scale the window to something like 480p it looks a lot better. But they steal subs from just about everyone and claim them as their own, so if you're not okay with that, don't use these.

Dat pic. "Your injured looks... / The sacred and profane. / Pleasure and the pain..."

Eh, I still prefer the work of one girl on pixi who ships Muza and Byman. Because they're soooooo tsundere, dontcha know. For best pic take a look inside this image collection (pixi id code: 17083590) Because around these parts, we deliver. Well, I try to anyway.

Here's the story background from the Odyssey storybook on the Quentians and the ancient Overmen. Gattai the two halves, and away you go!

The man over at Ani pages basically says that Taniguchi appears to have been recognized at being good at distilling Chirico's essence into moving drawings, and that's why he did so much genga. Shioyama was apparently a-ok with this development. You can check the ani pages post for more details on that. It's more detailed than the French interview as well so I won't bother posting that. Suffice to say that Taniguchi still does genga in the industry to this very day, which is rare as most people move beyond that in their career. Check out his credentials and you might be surprised at what he's worked on. He still counts Votoms as one of his favorites, out of all the stuff he's worked on.

I just uploaded the original Winner, the devocal karaoke version and the lyrics to here:
http://www.mediafire.com/?8534xbt9k8g8phv

I had a mess around with the devocal version that >>7830389 kindly made, mixing three tracks to try and get some drums back in. You can hear Mio a tiny bit in the background now, which I figured might help with actually singing it/keeping time. It's so faint that it'll be drowned out easily by /m/ voices anyway.
I can't really tell if this 'devocal version 2" is especially useful though. See what you think.

Whoa...! What the..?
So, is this some kind of balancing software that tunes down certain levels of the song? This is good and totally karaoke-able, though it sounds like a lot of the drums and guitars have kind of got lost along with Mio's voice...
Still a lot better than the electro trumpet SRW karaoke version though!

Also, I am totally happy with The Winner being in the lead. Heh heh.

Speed Hard Cap: 24.9
Note: You get more out of your custom points for AGI, HP, SPD but less for OC.

Q. Is there hard caps for other stats?
A. No.

Q. What does Agility affect?
A. Higher Agility shortens animations like stopping a boost, changing direction, starting a boost, etc. The speed of melee and projectiles are not affected.

Q. What servers are /m/ on?
A. NA mainly. Some of us are on KR and SEA though.

Note, if you're a new player don't be concerned about learning how to do advanced techniques. Focus on learning tactics, taking cover, maneuvering, and teamwork. B ranks are good to start off with because your mistakes are cushioned a bit. C ranks are also worth trying if you want to train spartan style.

God dammit.
Anyway one of the results of the relevant google search gets you to a download link. Mirroring such things kinda goes out of my personal philosophy, though...

I do have the PSX disc image rar'd up (as a set of 5 50MB RAR chunks for the bin/cue), if that counts...

I'd say it's a typical action game. You get Mars, Solar and Luna and can swap on the fly with the triggers. You get all of the DEVA pilots from the show, level up stats (only basics like HP, defense, attack) and the pilot proficiency of each formation.

Yes, you can toss anyone in any Vector. I'd say that's the best part of the game. They aren't locked. IE: You can have Apollo use Mars, Pierre use Luna and Sirius use Solar and they all get new attacks depending on which they one they use.

Though yeah, she needs to change up her grammar quite a bit. Presentation is part of one's image.

Also I got most of my reaction images from a thread on /v/ by Yakui AKA that guy who posts Shotacon/Traps all the time where he uploaded 2500+ various reaction images. I found it in the archives, but his mediafire account was taken down. It's somewhat common stuff, but there's a hidden gem every here and there like this animated version of the DESTROY Kornheiser pic.

Q. What servers are /m/ on?
A. NA mainly. Some of us are on KR and SEA though.

Note, if you're a new player don't be concerned about learning how to do advanced techniques. Focus on learning tactics, taking cover, maneuvering, and teamwork. B ranks are good to start off with because your mistakes are cushioned a bit. C ranks are also worth trying if you want to train spartan style.

The writer for this episode is Susumu Takaku. He's best known for writing episodes for Mazinger Z (particularly the first 2 episodes) Cutey Honey, GoLion, Devilman, and the screenplays for the first Fist of the North Star movie, and Mazinger Z vs Devilman. So if you've seen any of his works before this probably isn't going to be too bizzare for you. For the rest of you, I hope you like sneezing power, soccer balls, creepy pedo clowns, and "Pussy Posca".

That's all for this week! We'll see you next week with a truly historic episode, and the start so a truly amazing storyarc.

It's a fun mod which actually scales back the difficulty and does some fun things with units, like Gilliam's Gespenst has a Gespy Kick and everyone you have in the infamous stage 15 has SP Regen to make it less painful.

I found a blogspot which has mediafire links to the Maskman Movie. I don't think it has the rest of EJT's stuff, as it seems like it only has uploads for complete series. I tried searching for Five Man and it didn't show any results, but a search for Maskman shows links to cscentral's tv series subs and EJF's for the movie.

I can't quite remember where I got sonic stage, but here, have some fucking mediafire, I think that should work.
http://www.mediafire.com/?b22qot88ptxd2oq

As for ATRAC3+ I've got this file "??COMDLG32.ocx", so just rename it to "comdlg32.ocx".

But I personally don't bother with it, I can't get that shit to work, must be because I am a faggot who constantly downloads the latest revision(2554 right now, it autofixes the crash problems in 37) so that's a reason why it might not work...

The Federation Fleet charges into the Thunderbolt sector in full force. However, as soon as they start to clear the smoke screen, they're picked off in meticulous precision by the enemy! With their squad leader taken out, the unit is thrown into disarray. Just as things prove dim for the team, Ensign Io Flemming accomplishes the unimaginable after his GM takes a critical hit...

Dynamic Superobot Wars - Super Robot Retsuden Chapter 1

The ultimate cross over manga featuring Mazinger Z, Great Mazinger, Grendizer, Getter Robo, Getter Robo G and Jeeg! These all-stars band together in order to defend Earth from cosmic evil. This manga is in the same vein as all those old Toei cross over movies, and the self-parody gets pretty strong later on. This series by Ken Ishikawa has been collected into one volume featuring ten chapters.

I've been having a bitch of a time stealing Santo movies online. Are there some secret Mexican piracy circles out there?

Up until last week they've been showing Santo (and occasionally Blue Demon solo) movies on Galavision.

Also from what I've researched Santo probably never fought a robot that looked like one. There was apparently this time he fought Other Good Guy who was really a robot, but it wasn't like a cardboard box robot like Robot vs The Aztec Mummy.

Various Santo movies: http://www.mediafire.com/?bfagd60ql8y2z

Santo movies I've liked off the top of my head
Santo vs. The Zombies, Santo vs. The Vampire Women, Santo in The Witches Attack, Santo vs. The Martian Invasion, Santo vs. the Killers from Other Worlds (Santo vs a Blob), Santo vs. The She-Wolves.

Distract Sakuya first and then send out others to deal with Kurumi and Elly. If all you want is to get the WP, just have Marisa say hi to Yuuka in order to make Yuuka 'officially' name her attack Master Spark.

Otherwise, if you want to shoot her down, you'll need to have been playing the game just leading up to that moment (upgrade distribution, ability unlocking, etc). Anyway, don't forget to abuse character abilities such as Reimu's Youkai Buster and make good use of upgrades based on who you think can best Support Attack.

And does anyone know what patch version is in the mediafire download? Patch 1.00 has a bug where Flash never goes away after you activate it.

I promised this video way back when it was nothing more than a youtube vid on Erina's youtube channel and MEGAMAX was nothing more than a few magazine scans and a theater release date. Time flies! The only raw I could find of this was a youtube rip and a HDTV rip. Unfortunatly the HDTV rip was MPEG, which meant that it and Aegisub didn't get along. So long story short I used an avi version. It's not the best looking but it works and uh, deal with it.

If any of the mediafire links don't work they should be in the author's sites...kind of confusing to find in there, but it should be easy to find.

When you dump, you post every goddamn picture here, not just post mediafire link because no one's interested in your fucking virus.

A Zaku II Sniper type hides itself in the Thunderbolt sector. Meanwhile, an operation begins with the intent of gaining total control of this sector, which is a supply route to the fortress A Baoa Qu within Zeon’s sphere of influence. To accomplish this task and take out the sniper, the Federation Forces fleet and mobile suit unit are led by the Mua Brotherhood, former inhabitants of the Mua space colonies destroyed by Zeon. All 24 units of the mobile suit unit sortie. Among them is Ensign Io Flemming, pilot of the GM204F.

Note: You get more out of your custom points for AGI, HP, SPD but less for OC.

Q. Is there hard caps for other stats?
A. No.

Q. What does Agility affect?
A. Higher Agility shortens animations like stopping a boost, changing direction, starting a boost, etc. The speed of melee and projectiles are not affected.

Q. What servers are /m/ on?
A. NA mainly. Some of us are on KR and SEA though.

Note, if you're a new player don't be concerned about learning how to do advanced techniques. Focus on learning tactics, taking cover, maneuvering, and teamwork. B ranks are good to start off with because your mistakes are cushioned a bit. C ranks are also worth trying if you want to train spartan style.

I uploaded what's subbed of Dagwon and Exkaiser awhile back.

Would anyone happen to have PDSG's Might Gaine Episodes? I couldn't find them anywhere last time I looked.

You can get the gist of what's happening.
I put a few up soft-subbed at http://www.mediafire.com/?94k8tluwal538 , the whole thing's hard-subbed out there somewhere.

Well you can get Liger with torrents here:

But it only has 2 seeds and my upload is only around 70 kb/s. Stuff like this is usually really poorly seeded and takes forever to download which is why I uploaded it to mediafire.

Note: You get more out of your custom points for AGI, HP, SPD but less for OC.

Q. Is there hard caps for other stats?
A. No.

Q. What does Agility affect?
A. Higher Agility shortens animations like stopping a boost, changing direction, starting a boost, etc. The speed of melee and projectiles are not affected.

Q. What servers are /m/ on?
A. NA mainly. Some of us are on KR and SEA though.

Note, if you're a new player don't be concerned about learning how to do advanced techniques. Focus on learning tactics, taking cover, maneuvering, and teamwork. B ranks are good to start off with because your mistakes are cushioned a bit. C ranks are also worth trying if you want to train spartan style.

Mediafire seems to do some kind of CRC check at the start of an upload to see if the file you are uploaded has already been uploaded. Do they take down files that have had claims against them in the past automatically or something?

Also worth mentioning is that the Jushin Liger manga was by Uncle Go.

And while we're talking Uncle Go I also uploaded Psycho Armor Govarior (which took a week to get off torrents). It's not very good quality but it's better than the VHS rips which are the only other set I saw when searching for them.

Well it took me a month and a half to get this off torrents so I uploaded it to mediafire.

I also got the two episodes Onibaku subbed a long time ago before MU went down. The quality on it was really bad so I fixed the timing a little and put them with the raws I got from the torrent.

I think it's a really cool show.

Tactical Error posted the VOTOMS game a long time ago (2010). I uploaded it to bayfiles a couple months ago in one part but it got deleted due to nobody downloading it for a month (which is one of the reasons bayfiles kind of sucks).

So, I dunno if any of you remember, but a few weeks ago, or maybe months, I vectored up half the switches from Fourze. Well, I got bored at work today and vectored up the rest. I did this instead of my actual job, and honestly I feel like this was more productive. Enjoy!

the OVAs are usually received better. the film version has some extra scenes here and there (most of them with lower quality and not quite relevant) and a different version of one of the final fights (the film version is a bit more crude). alternatively, you could download the "complete version", which is a fan edit of the OVAs to include the extra footage of the films. some anon gently offered to upload them to mediafire some hours ago for another anon in need, I think the links will appear here in a matter of 5 - 6 hours.

okay, so here's an encode of Rebirth.
It looked like total shit on the original DVD, and handbrake autocrops the black parts as it's not anamorphic. Just letterbox. It cut off a few pixels from the movie in the process but it's not missing anything important. Next time I'm at work I'll up the whole dvd so if somebody wants it encoded a particular way they can do it themselves.

Someone should upload it to mediafire so /rs/ catches the link, MF won't let me upload anything right now for some reason.

GoogleiqdbSauceNAO Shin vs Neo grain.png, 3 MB, 1728x972
Anonymous Sat May 05 2012 11:25:03 No.7733418 ViewReport	
Okay, recently uploaded Armageddon (http://www.nyaa.eu/?page=torrentinfo&tid=311382) IS the earlier rip, just as I feared. I finally remembered to check files with mediainfo, and it gives absolutely same info. Russian "raw provider", eh? He just downloaded it from where it was uploaded first time. I should've expected this to be the only option.
Now about Shin vs Neo (http://www.nyaa.eu/?page=torrentinfo&tid=311379). Well... Looks like it is not bad overall, but fuck, it's grainy. Damn grainy. I suppose it may be the source, but it is very hard not to note it, it is very clearly visible - check attached image (I had to resive it a little though, original .png was a little too large to upload ). It looks better in motion, but still... And yeah, I cannot make a sample from an actual episode right now, so have creditless op to check by yourself: http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?es88i93kvkk6ii5
No update on New Getter, sorry - download is going slowly.

Also, picrelated. I never saw that Saotome has SUCH an awesome rapeface in the opening. I mean, I saw his face before, but damn, it's priceless. And I found it only because file is still not fully dowloaded. Fuck.

Gundam Films
Anonymous Fri May 04 2012 14:49:32 No.7730914 ViewReport	
Hi,
I am looking for a DDL link for the 3 Gundam films (the ones made out of the TV show) (I have seen Seed and 00, need to move on, became a huge fan)
Mobile Suit Gundam
Mobile Suit Gundam: Soldiers of Sorrow
Mobile Suit Gundam: Encounters in Space
And also
Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam

Unfortunately I can't use torrents ATM, so DDL Link is the only option (Mediafire or torrent.to are Deluxe, but I'll take whatever available).
Of course I’d like to have them in Japanese with English, French or German subs!
I am sure you know some good sites..
Thank you very much guys

Mirroring this because the torrent is dying. I got lazy and just ran the folder it was in through WinRAR, so the entire series is there in the 26 files. I'll mirror the episodes on another site separately sometime later, if someone doesn't beat me to it.

Good day gentlemen!

We have finally finished scanlating what is available of Linebarrels of Iron, which we started about a year ago here on the board.

Vol17 - http://www.mediafire.com/?eu58kheyp4nb6th
Vol18 - http://www.mediafire.com/?an78v73x73kt6ki

Past volumes/chapters can be found here:
http://smgscanlations.wordpress.com/

Now that Linebarrels is for the most part, finished, what other series would the board like to see translated? The only raws I have on hand, that aren't currently being translated by other groups, is Fortune Brigade, FMP! Another and Front Mission Dog Style & Dog Life, the last of which is currently receiving official french translations. We will also take suggestions of other series for our next project!

So I started putting together rars of my image collection.
The closest I ever came to sorting things is just dumping them in a directory labeled the date or some rogbu422ron I mashed into the keyboard. So they're just rared according to the date. And I pulled the smut because I'm pretty sure mediafire is technically sfw.
http://www.mediafire.com/?31mlkgtx72v64 is the first batch.

And having actually looked through my stuff, I found I had the Armored Core Chronicle (the Last Raven Portable book, which has a whopping two pages on AC5), and the (not very good) manga Tower City Blade. So as to not make this a content-free thread, here's both of those:
http://www.mediafire.com/?wdopre1a67y48m3 Chronicle
http://www.mediafire.com/?mxpjsmk2kbm89p7 Tower City Blade

The Chronicle scans aren't the greatest in the world, so if there's better out there, feel free to link it. Also, the Chronicle has a very suspicious lack of Kawamori-penned designs. It's not so bad because his involvement with the series scaled back considerably after AC3, but the AC3 section is somewhat lacking because of this.

And yes, these took forever to upload.

This is a little known, or at least little watched, Korean toku that got four episodes translated by Evolution Fansubs.

It's about a group of people taken out of different times in history to help save a civilization from an evil lord. Three of them are from the past, two of them are from the present, and the other two are part of the civilization that needs saving.

Both the villain dynamic and the dynamics of the heroes are what separates this show from most others.

I've never heard anybody having to wait that long on BayFiles (I've never had to wait at all myself). BayFiles is the only file host that hasn't screwed me in some way since the Megauplocalypse, but hey, I'm not married to it, so if you know a better file host, I'm listening. Mediafire would be okay otherwise, but I hate split files and their limit is still 200 MB per file.

After SSO and Battle Spirits Heroes is Go-busters and Fourze. Usada has been kidnapped by Enter for Enetron; can the wisecracking buddyroid be saved in time?

With the sudden deal with Aries, Ryusei has took Gentaro’s life, is this the death of Kamen Rider Fourze or will the cosmic power of friendship defie all logic?

Showtime will begin in less then a half hour, get your streams ready!

It's funny that people bitch about Katoki drawing everything the same, since that's EXACTLY what Kyoshi Takigawa does. Literally everything in the RX-78 and GM master archive share 60% of the same legs. Ironically, that homogenization of the Federation MS frame may be unimpressive from a drawing standpoint, but it actually works to the lore's benefit, since it make it a bit more believable that the Federation was able to pump out so many GM and Gundam Variants, since they're basically all built on the same frame.

All done. SRW MX Portable ISO coming right up:

pt3 - http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?ohwxkh5iytfobq7

I would test it to make sure it works before throwing it in the archive, WinRAR and Mediafire were both giving me a hard time here and that was the first time I've ever actually done this.

Still there? MediaFire's being a prick with one of the files for some reason, had to upload it a second time. Should have all three parts together fairly soon hopefully. MXp is only about 1.2GB uncompressed.

Note: You get more out of your custom points for AGI, HP, SPD but less for OC.

Q. Is there hard caps for other stats?
A. No.

Q. What does Agility affect?
A. Higher Agility shortens animations like stopping a boost, changing direction, starting a boost, etc. The speed of melee and projectiles are not affected.

Q. What servers are /m/ on?
A. NA mainly. Some of us are on KR and SEA though.

Note, if you're a new player don't be concerned about learning how to do advanced techniques. Focus on learning tactics, taking cover, maneuvering, and teamwork. B ranks are good to start off with because your mistakes are cushioned a bit. C ranks are also worth trying if you want to train spartan style.

I am no WinRAR expert. I recreated the RAR using the same parameters I used the first time. If it does not work for you I will upload the other 3 parts as well.

I checked my source file for Episode 11 and it is actually incomplete. I am re-downloading it now at which point I will re-archive it and finally re-upload it.

If you need to download music that's correctly tagged and of decent quality (you can have FLAC if you must) at least hone in your Google-fu skills. Yes you can download them off YouTube if you can find a video of a song that's been done in HQ and a decent converter, but it'd be better off looking at these sites:

nyaa
nipponsei
gendou
bakabt (yes they do soundtracks)
tpb
isohunt
Google (type down name song, then mediafire, filestube or something)

Gundam-san. It's a gag manga based on 0079 by Hideki Ohwada, same guy who made The Legend of Koizumi. That and its "sequel", Gundam Sousei (a fictionalized retelling of the production of 0079) are fully translated on Mediafire.

Note, if you're a new player don't be concerned about learning how to do advanced techniques. Focus on learning tactics, taking cover, maneuvering, and teamwork. B ranks are good to start off with because your mistakes are cushioned a bit. C ranks are also worth trying if you want to train spartan style.

Kamen Rider Agito Full Series + Movie + Specials - Now with GomenRider Subs
Anonymous Sun Apr 15 2012 08:41:05 No.7658397 ViewReport	
Ready to go!
Count zero!
Kamen Rider Agito!

GomenRider Eps 1-28:
http://www.mediafire.com/?mg2keal540aag

Cruel Angel Productions Eps 29-End plus Movie and specials:
http://www.mediafire.com/?9p435g6hvk2ge

The entire series in the Cruel Angel folder, but you're gonna want to get the GomenRider episodes because they're better.

Everything in both folders can be downloaded independently. Like, if you only want the movie, you can get that. You can join the .00X files using 7zip or HJsplit.

I'm reposting this because if people don't download the files Mediafire deletes them.

If anything is missing from the Cruel Angel folder let me know, unless it's episodes 1-28.

Enjoy, bros.

Few interesting things: This takes places before episode 1 of the anime. You'll notice Kanade carries a container of pills around her neck and has to take one before she transforms. Minister Hiroki has an appearance, he's the guy that Ryoko had killed during the series. Ryoko and Kanade play Dragon Quest based on the references in the dialog on page 11 (I did not add those). "FG-Type" is never explained but I assume it stands for "(F)Phonic Gain." There's a lot of technical jargon that's hard to translate, so I took a few minor liberties. I think you'll all agree "Power armor" just sounds better than "Special opportunity costume."

Feel free to comment/question, I'm always lurking.

Still looking for raws of the other chapters, btw. Vol 1 is due out in May, so hopefully then.

I wanted to thank the guy who uploaded Memorial Night to Mediafire. Or at least I think it was Mediafire.
I finally watched it yesterday and it was great. GRANRODEO advertising unrelated songs, Kuribayashi making us laugh, yuri seiyuu shenanigans, etc. I didn't know GRANRODEO's vocalist was Bakayuki. Even Yoshida... Yoshimura... erm, Kouki showed up.
And now I want to read TDA. I wonder what was that mecha with unlimited ammo they were trying to approach.

I also figured a few seconds ago that Track 06 of the Alternative OST 2 is Gunbuster's march. Damn.

Reposting in case Owarinaki OST anon missed it:

Thanks for the OST.I think I have identified two of the tracks.
Unidentified Cello Classical Piece 1: Bach, Cello Suite No.1 in G Major (Prelude)
Unidentified Violin Classical Piece 2: Bach, Partita III for Violin solo in E Major (Gavotte and Rondo)
Incidentally the two also showed up in Evangelion:Death as Shinji and Asuka's "solo"s, respectively.
The remaining two are either from the Baroque or Classical periods, but don't take me up on this. Maybe Bach, Mozart and/or pre-Eroica Beethoven?

Also, you don't mind if i post the TE scans here, right?

Apart from being quite slow, jumbo files was a good choice. Mediafire is what I think I'll stick too.

Speed Hard Cap: 24.9
Note: You get more out of your custom points for AGI, HP, SPD but less for OC.

Q. Is there hard caps for other stats?
A. No.

Q. What does Agility affect?
A. Higher Agility shortens animations like stopping a boost, changing direction, starting a boost, etc. The speed of melee and projectiles are not affected.

Q. What servers are /m/ on?
A. NA mainly. Some of us are on KR and SEA though.

Note, if you're a new player don't be concerned about learning how to do advanced techniques. Focus on learning tactics, taking cover, maneuvering, and teamwork. B ranks are good to start off with because your mistakes are cushioned a bit. C ranks are also worth trying if you want to train spartan style.

I have the 6.60 Pro B10, so I'm utterly lost as to why the thing isn't working. Am I missing a file or something that is stopping me?

I downloaded the mediafire parts, unzipped all of them together. It gave me a file folder and a BIN file. Try putting it in games, it says its corrupted, and I know the ISO tools isn't ready for it. I have the 6.60 Pro B10, so I'm utterly lost as to why the thing isn't working. Am I missing a file or something that is stopping me?

Delivering the revised Super Robot Wars Z II Hakai-Hen Walkthrough as promised. Most grammar mistakes and typoes fixed, most if not all names fixed as well (if your opinion differs just ctrl+r like I did).

If someone is wary of my link and wants to rehost, I don't care.
I just rushed a Geass run so I could go through its stages to my satisfaction, sorry then this is late. If you feel like an 11th-hour run and are a fast reader, maybe this will make the wait for a leak easier.

http://www.mediafire.com/?t0zohdep3o07t#1cd2a9ssws3sg ?

Since it's apparently not possible to download Youtube annotation, and it might be useful to have the subtitles in a more archiveable format

Only a small portion of what's in the game currently but better than nothing.
The titles are random because lolno Music Mode, and I think the Towa Naru Shirabe piece is what it is, but I don't remember if the bit I recorded it from is where it's supposed to actually play, and I can't be assed to check.

This wonderful release was brought to you with the help of Alkaid from Over-Time fame (and your weekly Xros Wars live summarizer). She's such a cool person to work with and she deserves more credit than I do. This video is a live version of Tagiru Chikara by Psychic Lover. Sadly it's not the best quality but it's all we could find and it's the lyrics that matter most right? Speaking of lyrics both of us racked our brains and gave this song an awesome overhaul. We hope you like the lyrics as much as we liked subbing them.

Me and Alkaid also have a few more things coming up for you guys real soon, some Digimon related, some not. Either way, this Xros isn't over yet. Enjoy!

Sorry about the delay on ddls being reuploaded. I am greatly missing being able to use my Multiupload uploader. It was simple and did it's job perfectly.

Ok here we go, link:
http://www.mediafire.com/?l4cdxhzi6z4c3dg
And a copy past of the quick guide thats inside the rar
Part 1:
" Disclaimer! READ THIS PART YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!
The odds of anything going wrong with a PSP and CFW related stuff these days is really low but in the event that something does go wrong and your PSP is bricked or anything else I take no responsibility for it.

1. Read this
2. ????
3. Profit!

But seriously psp hacking these days is a heck of a lot easier. Included in the zip file was a folder called update with eboot.pbp inside it, put that folder in your PSPs game folder (e.g. X:\PSP\GAME)
Also included in the zip file is a folder called 660-B10, open that folder and copy all the contents to your PSPs root directory (e.g. X:\) It will ask to over write some stuff as the folders already exist, hit yes."

Well Kanade fans, I bring sad news.

No booklet, no image for the CD. That fan art cover is the closest you're going to get. The CD sits with the BD disk in the case (see image). There is a booklet for the BD that includes some character design pages, but nothing specific to the CD.

If that wasn't enough I now know why poor Kanade's CD was limited to this BD release. It's because it only has 1 song, and that's the one she sang in the first episode (her version of the second song on Hibiki's character CD). So the CD only has that and the off-vocal version. Nothing else.

I uploaded rips of the two tracks in a rar file you can grab here:

Probably just upload folder by folder since the limit for them is 200mb/upload.

Well, seeing as I just got my Gundam Ace yesterday, this is probably the fastest release ever… then again, it took me 5 minutes to do since there’s maybe 3 pages of dialogue if that. All in all, this was a HUGE disappointment and I’m getting sick of these split up nothing is happening chapters lately. You’re disappointing me, Japan! Boo! *drops glory manga* Just kidding…

The raw at least. I was 100% sure that existed, just took a while to dig through the HDDs.

I'd share it but....what the fuck happened to mediafire? Why does it suddenly want me to create an account? What is this bullshit? What's another filehost?

Anyway I'm also about 95% sure this has been translated as well. I don't seem to have it save but I'm pretty sure someone on /m/ translated it and spammed it as a thread.

MuvLuv isn't about walking death machines killing aliens and all that. If you can't get into EXTRA and Unlimited, you will miss practically everything that the main story is all about. It's like eating a cake, but just eating the frosting.

Side stories are like small chunks of candy you can eat long after the cake has been finished. You can enjoy the candy even without the cake.

Reposting for those who didn't see it:


A week ago I mentioned that I would upload all of the GomenRider subbed episodes of Agito since it seemed like they were lost in the big collaspe of Megaupload. Well, it took longer than I expected but here you go:
http://www.mediafire.com/?mg2keal540aag

They are the mkv, soft subs, files and split into 2 piece rar downloads. Just download both and unrar it with whatever program you prefer.

Everything is in there and can be downloaded independently. Like, if you only want the movie, you can get that. You can join the .00X files using 7zip or HJsplit.

Fair warning: There's a lot of bad Kijima jokes in this ep, and an awful lot of bad imitation Kijima jokes. For the literalists out there I'll do a full post on the Aesir blag later about the literal meaning of them all, but I figured I'd post the script up now it's done and I can save the writeup for when there's muxes and stuff.

Having escaped the enemy on the space ship Manzana Flor, Font is screened to become a member of the team. Just as they’re heading to a briefing room, a broadcast is made by Tetenith Dogatie, head of the Jupiter Foundation. The mysterious “Angel Call” was stolen from them some time ago and they’re on a mission to get it back. The very existence of the mysterious meteorite spells catastrophe for the Earth sphere as well as all of mankind if it’s used! Through he separation from the Jupiter Republic, she proclaims the revival of the Crossbone Vanguard to find it no matter what! Font soon learns just how deadly Angel Call really is: it’s a strong pathogen that causes a fatal disease, a space microbe with a different base sequence!

With that, Crossbone is caught up.

A while back in a thread we had a discussion about a guitar version of the OP that plays in certain points of Macross. It wasn't on the ost.

I kept an eye out for it and the closest thing I've found is the Instrumental version of Macross from the ps2 game.

So guys, I've been searching for Dunbine's OST and it's been proven to be a difficult task. After much lurking, I've found the 1st and 2nd BGM collections (which I provide below), but the 3rd disk is impossible to find: all the links are dead, or just the first two are available. Anyone have it?

1: mediafire - /?1dy5m0dnmyy
2: mediafire - /?2mzylmiyznz

And, in the meantime, let's have a Dunbine thread, the series I'm yet to watch but fell in love because of the designs and soundtrack in SRW games.

If you need one that's subbed you might want to try the original Mazinger Z. Most of the old ones are raw.

Gold Lightan isn't that terrible, but HEY KIDS PLAY WITH LIGHTERS AND THEY'LL BE ROBOTS THAT RIP OUT THE BAD ROBOTS' HEARTS! is fairly wat.
I've got hks of some of that.

MOBILE SUIT CROSSBONE GUNDAM GHOST [CHAPTER.03]
Deacon Blues Tue Mar 13 2012 16:50:03 No.7524023 ViewReport	
MOBILE SUIT CROSSBONE GUNDAM GHOST
CHAPTER.03 MESSENGER FROM THOUCUS

Curtis goes to battle with the mysterious envoy from Jupiter. However, he’s having difficulty fighting an enemy he’s not familiar with! After having trained to recognize certain enemy mobile suits via audio feedback, the Crossbone Gundam has nothing on the new Desphys! Curtis is forced to rely on Font to convey information to him, but that doesn’t go over too well. Just when it seems like things have gone from bad to worse, the accompanying Zanscare forces attempt to move in, but they’re mowed down by the Desphys! Weren’t they working together?! Staring death in the face, Font takes things into his own hands by launching another mobile suit straight at the enemy!

Everything is in there and can be downloaded independently. Like, if you only want the movie, you can get that. You can join the .00X files using 7zip or HJsplit.

I'm reposting this because if people don't download the files Mediafire deletes them and the asshole that runs KRDL refuses to host them there.

Positron here (saw this thread as a referrer to my wordpress). What's wrong with BayFiles? Pretty much every other filehosting site I've tried sucks ass, except for MediaFire which has a 200MB limit. And torrents for every episode aren't much of an option because I'm a poor student with no income to rent a seedbox or anything like that. :V

And yeah those old subs are pure shit and everyone should stay away from them.

This episode is huge. Colonel Zol is kidnapping children to build a secret guerrilla army for Shocker (#Zol2012) and before Taki and Ichimonji can investigate, they have to face off against two reconstructed Shocker cyborgs!
Everything about this episode is great. The story, the action, the directing... there's a ton of great foreshadowing and a great scene between Taki and Ichimonji. You don't want to miss it!

Regarding the whole Maya thing, on the one hand, having Meiya and the other three around without Mana just feels sort of off.
On the other hand, based on AF, Maya is probably UN/AL Yuuhi's personal attendant or something similar, so it's only natural for her to be in TDA where Yuuhi also is.
Disregarding the fact that it's Meiya and not actually Yuuhi in TDA for the latter.

By the way guys if you want, here is my save files.

This is a complete .rar of all the savedata for Battle Moon Wars spanning from the first stage to the last bonus stages that are acquired from having max battle mastery as well as clear save data. Sometimes, there are multiple saves for one stage and that is usually to denote different stages in upgrading for that particular part in the game. In any case, enjoy.

I don't suggest using this on your first play through because the game really is fun and reasonable with it's Battle Masteries.

I know the feeling. Mitsuki in general is a character who does things and appears strong, but inside is weak and fragile. BETA-verse Mitsuki had to get over some things and grow stronger and more independent, which shows more of her characters good sides.

Wait a minute, looks like those links are down. One of the thing bayfiles does is delete files after a month of inactivity. Can anyone else upload them? I have them but my shitty 60kb/s upload is tied at the moment.

And while we are having a Braves thread, I uploaded the first 17 episodes of Dagwon subbed here (that torrent just doesn't stay seeded, I had to personally ask Macros74 to reseed it himself):

Here are some Black RX subs I found (all the episodes): http://www.mediafire.com/?fu8b7jwi213q42m

Not sure if they're some official translation or what, but they seem alright so far. Then again I'm not really that picky when it comes to subs.

I'll check the reupload when I get back home. MediaFire doesn't want to do any cooperation with me, so some of the suggestions most likely won't show up until I upload them manually one by one rather than using the batch function.

And I have to decide between âge fan stuff, Chronicles 3 or Iron Sky this month.

Haha. I didn't even expect it to get to this size considering there was only 17 image layers. Totally didn't try to find images of short hair Mitsuki in a pilot suit for two hours. Either way I think I got enough for new art every month for awhile. Pity that would be too much of a hassle.
>Can't upload 273MB file to mediafire

Could somebody please translate one of this guy's works? He did Feddie Hooligans, Gundam Katana and Acguy: 2250 Miles Across North America....they're all insane with crazy characters doing crazy shit and I think it would be great fun to have any of it in English.

Plus, he names his chapters after classic english rock songs, what more do you want?
